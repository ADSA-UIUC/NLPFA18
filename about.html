  <h1>About Our Project</h1>
</div>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
We started off with <a href="https://mentalhealthforum.net">this site</a> to find forum posts 
to figure out what kind of people exist on this forum and post here. Using Natural Language 
Processing (or more specifcally just Sentiment Analysis), our pgorject was just to figure out,
given one person's input text or a given username, to find people who have posted similar 
things to the target person so that the target person would have someone to talk to.
</p>

<p></p>

<h1>Goal</h1>
<p>
To create a piece of code that could:
<p>
<code>input:</code> username of someone already on the forum (in which case we find the text 
that they typed so far) OR some sample text that someone would have typed   
</p>
<p>
<code>output:</code> a person (username) or a group of people that have already contributed on 
this forum that have typed similar things (sentiment-wise) to the input.
</p>

<h1>Process</h1>
<p>
Our main project was split into two portions: <b>Webscraping</b> and <b>Data Analysis</b>, 
headed by different people in the project.
</p>
<h2>Webscraping</h2>
<p>
The main goal of the webscraping group is to simply scrape the forum and retrieve the data in 
a usable format for the analysis group. This consisted of using <code>Python</code>'s 
<code>BeautifulSoup</code> package and the <code>Selenium</code> package, as well as 
<code>pandas</code> to format the data.
</p>

<h3>Scraping the website</h3>
<p>
Each forum has a lot of posts, but each one has a pretty similar format, so scraping it 
was a matter of figuring out which elements belonged to each piece of data that we wanted, 
and compiling that into a <code>.csv</code> file that could be read later. The following 
picture shows how each of the elements were extracted, and using <code>BeautifulSoup</code> 
made searching for and extracting certain elements easy. Although the analysis group was not 
able to end up using every piece of data that could be extracted from every post, there were 
many challenges in the "edge cases" that could mess up our data.
</p>

	<img src="/static/mapToCsv.png" style="width:100%">
</a>

<p>
As shown, we can extract the date and time that the post was made, the user that originally 
posted, a user that the original user quoted (if there was one), the post text, and which post 
number it was (in this picture the numbering is 1 off because of 0-indexing (so post #1 would 
be counted as row 0 in the output file)).
</p>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p>
The primary goal of the data analysis group was to use the data that was collected and try to 
make sense of it. Some methods we ended up using include: <b>sentiment analysis</b> using 
the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/">Watson Tone Analyzer</a> 
service offered by IBM, <b>dimensionality reduction</b> using the 
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/"><code>scikit-learn</code></a> package, and 
the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">K-means clustering algorithm</a></b> 
using the same <code>scikit-learn</code> package (<i>*note: originally, we had written our 
	own k-means algorithm, however, this was too slow to use, and 
	<code>scikit-learn</code> was much more optimized</i>).
</p>
<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
<p>
Sentiment analysis, or having a computer figure out what a sentence "feels like," is a 
ongoing topic of research in natural language processing. Think about it this way: how do 
you think we can discern whether a sentence is <font color="red">angry</font> or 
<font color="blue">sad</font>, or maybe even <font color="purple">tentative</font>? There are 
numerous algorithms that people much smarter than us thought of, and here we use the one by 
IBM, called the 
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/">Watson Tone Analyzer</a>. This API 
(Application Programming Interface) allows us to be able to use someone else's algorithm in our 
own code. Watson Tone Analyzer, for us, solved the problem of doing sentiment analysis and 
trying to figure out a way to turn textual data into numerical data, that we could process 
easier.
</p>
<p>
For example (as taken from the <a href="https://tone-analyzer-demo.ng.bluemix.net/">
Watson Tone Analyzer Demo</a>), we can give this algorithm a piece of text such as
</p>
<p><i>I hate these new features On #ThisPhone after the update.</i></p>
<p>
and the Watson Tone Analyzer could give us back a value such as <code>Anger: 0.64</code>, 
indicating that their algorithm was 64% sure that anger was a sentiment that was present in 
this piece of text. By feeding it other pieces of text data, we can effectively turn our 
text data that we had retrieved from the mental health forum and turn it into numbers that we 
could use.
</p>

<p><i>
Note: For <a href="/explore.html">the demo</a>, we did not provide pieces of text from the 
mental health forum. This is to preserve the privacy of the users on that site, and instead 
we used the <a href="https://newsapi.org/">NewsAPI</a> site to provide us with news headlines 
that would be more user friendly to read and probably more polar in terms of emotion, to allow 
for a better user experience.
</i></p>

<h3>Finding Similar People</h3>
<p>
The original goal of the project was to use sentiment analysis in order to find people who were 
writing posts of a similar sentiment in order to "match" people to other people that they could 
talk to. Original ideas included:
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Using keyword analysis to summarize someone's piece of text</li>
		<li>Using dates and times of postings to see if a forum's posts changed over 
			time</li>
		<li>Using "tagged" individuals to possibly create a graph of how users were 
			related, and what kinds of people seemed to be helped in each form</li>
	</ul>
<p>
But, as you have probably noticed, we have not reached those goals yet. As for completing this 
goal of finding similar people, we could only use the limited data we have about the sentiments 
of each post. This is definitely not enough information, <i><b>nor do we have the domain 
knowledge to make an executive decision about who could be a good candidate for someone else
</b></i>. Although we would love to be able to analyze this website further, this is about as 
far as we got. The demo does not include actually finding similar people, although we could, 
because of the limitation that these demos should be quick and easy to understand for the user. 
</p>

<h1>The Demo</h1>
<p>
The demo consists of two main portions: 1) using the drag and drop interface in order to group 
different posts that you think have a similar sentiment, and 2) clicking "Generate Analysis" 
and seeing how the computer managed to group them.
</p>
<h3>Drag and Drop Interface</h3>
<p>
This interface is made so that you can group the news headlines that are being presented in a 
way that you think would be the most similar. In other words, two headlines that you think both 
express an <font color="red">angry</font> emotion should be placed in the same group. You 
don't have to think about this like a computer; this demonstration is for us as humans to 
understand the differences between how computers might imagine emotions versus how us 
as humans might think about emotions.
</p>
<h3>Computer's Groupings</h3>
<p>
This section is for understanding how the computer actually grouped them. The computer took 
the values that the Watson Tone Analyzer from before and tried to group them in a few groups so 
that similar values would be grouped together. Was your result different? If so, in what way? 
The goal was simply to make you think about how computers think, so there is no right answer.
</p>


<h1>From Here</h1>
<p>
From here, although we're unsure of whether we can continue this project, we would like to see 
what kinds of patterns show up in text corpuses such as these. Could an analysis like this be 
used on a larger scale to determine what a group of individuals think? There have been many 
projects using natural language processing, and we hope that we have inspired a few more to 
start their own.
