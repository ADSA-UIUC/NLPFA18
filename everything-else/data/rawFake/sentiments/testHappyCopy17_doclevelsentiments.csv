3,person1,"b'hearing the girl i liked accepting to be my girlfriend. It didn't work out but i still remember i was the happiest dude alive, on top of the fucking world. Before that i was so self-conscious but knowing that someone liked me enough to want to spend time with me in a relationship made me the happiest man and in general just confident with myself.
