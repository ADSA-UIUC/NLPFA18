I'm sorry you're struggling so!!I have been drinking lately too but decided that yesterday would be my first sober day! yay!So how are you feeling today? Sometimes I've felt that drinking helps the situation sometimes it hinders. I hope it helped you escape for a bit. Tho the mental health providers will want you to stay away from the booze.I don't know what country most of ya'll are from? I'm in the USA.I'm new to this forum and would like to give encouragement to you! Hopefully you woke up today and you feel better. Since its Monday hopefully these stupid crisis workers will get with it! ARGH! Ticks me off too!Ya'll seem to be a great sisterhood! I think that is wonderful. I don't know what a lot of the verbage is that ya'll write about?? Remember if you have a hangover ladies to drink lots of water. If you ever drink again drink water with it.It helps keep you hydrated which is the problem with drinking cuz it dehydrates us and that's what makes the headache. ssoda crackers work well for nausea.I know that is the least of your problems. Its very disconcerting to have the voices. sounds like you need a med change?? overall I've been satisfied with my injection of invega but its 300.00 a mos. and cannot afford it anylonger so going back on Risperdal. ughAntiphychotics if you get on the right one really can help you. I don't know your history of course so pardon if i'm ignorant of your circumstances. Again, I'm really sorry. Hang tuff! Take care, Parakeet""",0.533612,0.0,0.614779,0.570233,0.0,0.0,0.706892

58,pepecat,"b""There is, unfortunately, a sort of ''buyer beware' with therapy, in that it may well leave you feeling worse initially before it gets better. My therapist did warn me of that at the start of mine, but me being me, it took about 18 months before i really started opening up and talking about stuff, so for me the last year was really hard. It does get better though. I think there's a point where old defences and coping mechanisms are kinda being opened up and dismantled a bit, but the new ways of managing aren't quite concrete enough, so there is a period where you feel all over the place. My therapist said it's part of the process, and a sign that real change is happening. It's not unusual at all, and decent therapists should know about it, warn you about it, and be able to keep you safe while the therapy is happening - i.e by not rushing things and being able to handle whatever you tell them, and be able to 'contain' you and your emotions during the process. Can you contact your therapist in between sessions if you need to? I know you've only had the first one, but when things got really tricky for me, my therapist said i could call her if i was feeling wobbly. I did it twice, and it really helped. I know they don't generally like to encourage that (contact in between sessions) but sometimes it is appropriate. Could you tell your therapist in the next session how you've been feeling in between? It might get them to slow down a bit and take it a bit more gently - they shouldn't really push you too hard at the start as they need to see where you're at and build the relationship.

Life can be really hard sometimes... well for many a lot of times. For me I find coloring with 144 crayons or some such can soothe me, listening to non vocal music that is not symphony helps me, sitting on my back patio listening to the birds and the gurgling water from my fountain help before the day gets away from me in nice weather anyway, I had an inside fountain that was really small that I used to listen to too, unless that is trigger because of tub, ummm going for a walk indoors in a mall and just ignoring everyone else and doing window shopping, buying a small portion of food I love just for the day, putting vaporub or sucking a lemon or lime wake me right up..., ....That's all I can think of... When I go to the shopping center (don't know what they call that in UK) I go to the parfume counters and try and get free samples. They usually are always glad to give you some.Life is frustrating! Sometimes if you can play the 15 mins. game.... You clock 15 mins. and say you will go at least 15 mins. without doing sh and then once you get to that 15 mins. you clock another 15 mins. and so on and so forth.

His telling me don\'t tell ""It\'ll kill your mother"" led me to a lifetime of hiding it every time I had s abuse, You were a child, you were a victim, we cannot at young ages comprehend what love involving s is, especially if like me you had a disfunctional family where critisizm is rampant and nurturing almost non existant.The flashbacks when they first hit me felt like a freight train of sickness in the pit of my stomach, they were so disjointed and relentless with the emotional connection you feel with everyone that hits. Try to think of it like a huge jigsaw puzzle with every flashback you add another peice to the full puzzle, the more pieces you add the slower the flashbacks will be, and the clearer you will understand about yourself.They won\'t be this way forever and you will gain full recall. Don\'t hate yourself for loving him back you didn\'t know any better, children will do anything to love and for the love of their parents, even when their parents are their abusers. Try to be patient with yourself. You will get through this and it will get better.

298,Gajolene,"b""I felt the emotional flatness to, without knowing it I had dissaociated and buried emotions for so many years I really wasn't capable of feeling anything but sorrow, and pain, for myself and for the life of me I couldn't understand why. It was something that as a child and throughout my first 30yrs I somehow had learned to automatically lock away. When my first PTSD episodes hit, even though previously I had remembered the abuses I had never emotionally connected with them, they were vaugue recollections I would automatically shut off emotionally, give my head a shake and continue on. When the flashbacks hit, I would get so overwhelmed by huge flashes of emotion, 100 times what one would normally feel, It was like a grieving process only for myself, the flashebacks I couldn't turn off, rather than simple recall of an event like watching a tv show would trigger these massive emotional rememberance waves, sorrow was total despair, anger became rage, and so on.With the flashbacks things suddenly started to make sense, why I had misdirected all negative towards myself, why I hadn't been able to feel true emotions for so long. I wish I could describe it better, I wasn't in any therapy at the time and had not seen any doctors. The flashbacks came on fast, first one or two at day or in my dreams, then dramatically increased over the weeks till they were every few minutes of the day. I was sure at the time I had lost my mind. One particular event was the root of everything, the beginnings of a lifetime of disfunctional thinking and dissacociated feelings. When that flashback was complete, it completed the memory puzzle like an epiphany everything suddenly made perfect sense, but the PTSD symptoms lasted several years even after the full recall. I still have periods of anxiety/ panick and depression. I did quite a lot of cbt and rebt though online courses, and eventually with the advice of people like the ones on here did seek a therapist eventually where we delved into some scema based therapy as well. It seems my emotions go from one extream or another even now, I go from extream hypersensitivity in times of anx to flatness with depression. I hope some of you can relate and my experiences can help to some degree. At least I learned now where to place my emotions, and to put them where they belong when they do come rather than reflect everything inward as I programed myself to do as a child.

Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain. And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy; And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields. And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief. Much of your pain is self-chosen. It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self. Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity: For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen, And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.\xc2\x94 \xe2\x80\x95 Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet'",0.0,0.0,0.505724,0.698658,0.0,0.0,0.833904

Try and look after yourself at the moment whilst you are going through this. You said about s. abuse, about it repeating, i was molested by two different people about three years apart. The second person did it about six times. I kept letting it happen. I think vulnerable people, naive people, people without much confidence or stregth, do somehow let it repeat. I don't know why. I have my own theory about why i was so, i want to say stupid but i will say vulnerable. Obviously what you went through was worse than what i went through. Any violation is heartbreaking though and so i do understand on some small level how you feel. I think i probably had something tattooed on my forehead also. A sitting duck.

I also buy things like dark chocolate, the bitter taste, just a small piece, it is a comfort, a sensation. Last night i coloured to classicfm. It occupied me for about half an hour. Memories came, sad thoughts came, but i also felt some pleasure seeping through. trying to eat mindfully helps. I also have a bath and then get straight in bed and lay there for ten minutes. It is so soothing, snuggly. These little things help i find. I'm sure there are some things that help you through.Sorry if im teaching a granny to suck eggs. What a stupid phrase, never understood it, but you get what i mean!""",0.0,0.0,0.602442,0.574131,0.675419,0.0,0.865542

Some people i think are totally chemically dependent to this class of drug after being put on them, & it's impossible for some people to successfully come off, they go into severe physical withdrawal symptoms - regardless of what is tried - especially regarding length of time on these drugs & dosages, & other variables. i think some people can get off them, but only with first ideally having & setting in place proper resolution to the underlying difficulties, & proper help & support - without that things are hard to impossible.

I did ring c.m.h.t. back they were more understanding - I am so so freaked out even with diazepam its not calming me at all.I didn;t go cold turkey off the anti psychs, I was supervised and only came down 5mg every two weeks so it took months to come off them. I dunno whats happening.I have the crisis team tomorrow -'",0.0,0.596764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

752,keepsafe,"b'Well disclosed some very heavy stuff to my therapist and then in turn to my social worker. I feel a hatred and disgusted towards myself. I have an impulse and its not going away. I am lost, I have lost it. Voices are very bad, I had to cover my ears yesterday when seeing s.w.Very freaked out and feeling alone to deal with it all.I have some other meds now and they knock me out for a while so thats the best bit. Everything is magnified and the pressure is building and building the longer I stay awake.I have been hallucinating - I think soon they will force me back on my anti psychs.

753,mumdownunder,"b'I\'m so sorry to hear that you are struggling but glad you reached out for support. Changing/weaning from psych meds is definitely a challenge.I\'m sure you know deep down that you shouldn\'t feel disgusted because you have endured trauma but the mind has a way of manipulating things so much so that we feel disgust/guilt/hatred towards ourselves because ""Pandora\'s box"" has been opened. I find my urges increase exponentially after a therapy appt particularly a difficult session but I know you can ride the wave and stay safe.

754,keepsafe,"b""MDUIts certainly not easy, I am keeping in control only because I am putting myself to bed every day with the diazepam and some other sedatives. I think I am in withdrawal, it's not good at all. I want to seriously get someone to seriously harm me.I know there are people out there who will.I am trying so damn hard here, but the voices and hallucinations and the impulsiveness are driving me insane.I am in danger of losing everything.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
755,plaasmesisie,"b'Hi KSI want you to know we on this forum understand and care about you. please understand you are not a bad person - you are a good person that bad things happened to. You do not deserve to be hurt or injured in any way and I pray you will find the inner strength to get through these awful emotions and voices telling you otherwise.those are just lies and the best way to combat lies is with TRUTH! I have the same issue with voices in my head saying I will never be loved and nobody wants me\xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbdThen I go somewhere safe and I say out loud ""That\'s a lie!! I am loved and I have a purpose"" or something to that effect. Even just stating out loud to myself ""I will be ok"" can help to calm the terrible lies my mind conjures up. I also drown out the voices with loud happy music and sing at the top of my lungs. If that fails I go in the hot shower and scream out my pain. Then when I can control myself I call or text a friend for words of encouragement I hope you can find some coping mechanisms that will be helpful to you to get through these very traumatic times but know we as a forum group are always here to support you\xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd'",0.539082,0.0,0.624555,0.584115,0.640803,0.0,0.807012

Are you in with the hearing voices groups at all? Hope it passes soon for you and you can stay off. But if you feel your in danger don't hesitate to get yourself back into hospital. I must say you sound very lucid for someone going through so much at the moment? You sound like you have full insight into whats going on with you.Huge huge huge hugs.""",0.0,0.0,0.565895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.730029

759,Gajolene,"b""I think even though it's really bad, that the fact you know what is going on is a good thing, because you can rationalize whats happening in reality. If JD is off his meds all insight goes out the window and he has no idea how dangerous he is with himself and his family. Literally he lives in his lucid dream state or as I call it his other realities and there are many with him. Is there a friend you can call to check in on you? Very worried, keep posting here at least so maybe we can see the warning signs if things are getting to out of control and we can see it but you can't. We can signal you when we think it's gone to far and you need immediate help.""",0.0,0.616594,0.0,0.606791,0.905944,0.621183,0.0
