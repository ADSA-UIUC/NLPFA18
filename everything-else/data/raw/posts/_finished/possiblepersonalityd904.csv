4,2013-12-28 11:21:00,Kerome,"b""Getting a label can be an opportunity, it's a chance to look at your story and your symptoms from another direction, and maybe recognise some things that you didn't think of as symptoms. So I wouldn't dismiss it out of hand, and it can help you get access to therapy. Maybe it's worth going with it just for that.In the long run, I think it's like a coat, you have to feel comfortable wearing it. If you really don't feel it's you, you can try to get it changed, although as I understand things doctors aren't always helpful with that. Ultimately your story and what happened to you define your condition better than any label could, and there may be some comfort in that.Hugs """,,Doh

As long as they know what the right treatment is for me and I stick with that then a label shouldn't really matter.

50,2013-12-29 01:33:00,Gajolene,"b""lost girl theres a reason you are telling yourself these things that are not true, depression sucks us down into a deep hole and we feel like theres no way to climb out once we're in. What your doing is called negative self-talk . The reasons you are doing this and how long you've been doing this I don't know but I can tell you, you won't always feel this way, you can learn to stop believing these things, and telling yourself these things. I know because I was caught in a cycle of negative self talk myself from as early a 4 yrs old, I felt no-one would ever love me and that somehow I was bad, ugly and so on, wishing I was dead, feeling empty or crying for no reason other than I made myself sad by saying and believing these things to myself. I did this for years always wondering but not knowing why or how to fix it. Often doing it without even realizing it. I thought everyone hated me, I hid from people, and family, was scared to ask teachers for help because I thought I would get picked on and people would think I was stupid. I had no friends because I was just too scared to try. I did this well into my twenties and like you had no idea how to change it. But there is hope hun.The same way you learned to hate yourself and talk bad about yourself you can change, this may sound silly but try picturing yourself as a little girl locked away cold and alone for such a long time up inside in a dark room in the corner of your mind. Imagine yourself opening that door letting out that little girl out. Imagine hugging her and holding her and putting her beside your heart where its not dark but there is a warm red glow, safe and secure. Think of that little girl as you, then make a promise to her. Tell her she is beautiful, that she doesn't have to be afraid, that you will keep her safe. Imagine your little girl getting mad, really mad and let her scream it out in your mind all the things she wants to say, all the people she is really mad at instead of you, let her scream, let her cry out loud and the whole time tell her its OK you are there for her, you love her. Tell her she has a right to get angry and to be sad and more importantly tell her she can be happy and you will protect her. It may sound really silly but I did this and I vowed to myself that I would never put that girl back in the dark closet in my mind again, that I would carry her in my heart always showing her how beautiful, and strong, and important she was, I would tell her how brave she was to be in that dark place all those years and still be able to come out, I would tell her she was worthy of respect and value, that she never had to be scared to speak up again and I was setting her free. I realized that little girl was me.It may sound silly but believe me when I realized that little girl in my heart was me, I realized I really did deserve all those things too.. I started asking for help, I found a counsellor I could trust and I took CBT and RBT courses to learn how to change, I joined a forum like this where I could find people like me, who wouldn't judge me that I could talk to freely without fear and I learned how I could think about myself in a good way, The more I learned the stronger and prouder of myself I became, I didn't care what other people thought about me anymore and I started to become confident about myself and to let myself be happy, and to know I deserved to be happy. That I didn't have to be afraid to speak my mind.I needed pills for the first while to help me but I didn't need them forever, I eventually became strong enough to do it myself without pills.You deserve to be happy and feel strong and beautiful, don't let anyone tell you different including yourself. I hope you realize how brave you were to go into hospital and try to get help, to reach out, maybe your little girl is reaching out for you too hun. You take care of her, you promise to take good care of her so she can become the beautiful, strong, courageous young woman you are. This really did work for me, but it took me untill I was almost 30 to figure it out by myself, I had no support. You have already taken the first steps, you reached out here and you sought medical help as well. You may have a friend you can trust or a family member you can reach out to. If your scared hold you little girls hand and give the strength.

Still it is better to work with them and take the little bit of help, than to have nothing at all. So it's best to keep the appointments and see what is on offer.What is more important is putting yourself in a position to learn better habits for yourself, get access to therapy, and remove negative influences from your life. So I hope you get your housing situation sorted out, that would be a good step.But really it would be good to make a start on better mental habits as well. Things like a proper sleep routine, stopping negative self talk, finding ways to calm yourself in difficult moments, and perhaps starting some self help like positive affirmations or meditation would be a good idea. Or you could try an independent therapist online, to help you with these kinds of things on a regular basis.

Think it really has to be worked at - that in itself is tiring. There is a good website called dbtselfhelp.com which has loads of things to do on it. When I'm feeling desperate, wanting to self harm I've found distraction quite useful. This can be anything - some I do are listening to music, playing with a pet, bit of exercise, calling someone basically anything even cleaning the toilet if it diverts your attention for just a small amount of time. Self soothing is another thing I am learning to do and this is something I struggle with as I have a lot of hate for myself but basically this is about using your 5 senses ( vision, sound, touch, taste, smell) to comfort yourself eg snuggling in your duvet, listening to music that you enjoy, smelling a smell that you like. Looking at photos that bring back good memories. Lighting a candle and watching the flame. Having a long soak in the bath. You could also try doing something opposite to how you feel eg feeling really sad and upset then watch some comedy on the tv, listen to upbeat music. You may be reading this and thinking how the hell is this going stop me wanting to die? That's exactly how I felt to start with but slowly it's starting to work.""",,None

Volunteering sounds good but i bet it feels difficult to think about right now. It is worth just having a look when you can though, maybe just finding out what number to call or website to look on for volunteer work.

So when you are worrying about something like the CMHT have not rung, you can turn the thought around and say they are busy and will ring eventually, the fact that they have not rung doesn't mean anything bad. simple changing of thoughts to help you panic less. It takes a while to sink in though so don't worry if it is hard to begin with. Every extra little thing helps, you just have to be ready to try it, maybe not today but one day you could try it.

Visual meditation, by imagining positives states. It helps stop cycling negative thoughts. For an example...imagineIf you could have a fairy tale good life of any kind what would it be? living by a lake, a stream, a forest, a beach, for instance, try to imagine all the good things you wish for yourself, would you be a doctor, a lawyer, a mother, a nomad, a clerk at the corner shop? Run your own pub maybe, be the mayor....whatever you can imagine for yourself ..... you could focus on those positive things you wish for yourself and what they may be. Even better to do it with deep breathing exercises, Deep breathing really helps ease the anxiety and muscle stress together with what I mentioned before you can do deep breathing anywhere, sitting ,down, standing, driving, on a bus, or lying down or my favorite a in hot bubble bath Like I said these are things I used, I am not professional, but they really do help, every little positive counts when you are so low.

It is important, the biggest importance, is to be kind to yourself always. To look after yourself, do nice things for yourself, and for that inner voice to be kind. Your inner voice isn't usually kind and that might be what leads you down that spiral of depression that leads to self harming. Can you change that inner voice, it is like affirmations, it is like giving yourself a talking to, a rational voice, a calm and kind rational voice. It is really hard to do, especially when depressed, and yes you are depressed if you are suicidal, if you are self harming, if you are dreading waking up in the morning and feeling as bad as you do. You are unwell and so need to treat yourself accordingly, not unkindly with unkind words and self harm. All self harm is important, just because you are not stick thin and covered in deep scars, doesn't mean it is minor. It is all part of the package of the depression that you have. About the gym, i dread going too when feeling like this, but i do like going to sit in the jacuzzi or having a swim. It is part of my looking after myself, the soothing water, the warmth, the comfort. I hope your gym has a pool and sauna.""",,Amazed

It's a quick, easy fix which isn't about killing ourselves ( if we truly wanted to do that I think we would go all out and do it properly! ). Most people recognise that it relieves horrible emotions and for me anyway it can be quite an addictive habit. Obviously no one wants you to hurt yourself but if you are intending to do that it's about taking responsibility and reducing your risk- this is what I have been told by my cpn. Making sure you use clean items, you do it in places that have less risk, if you do it looking after it afterwards to stop infection etc etcSelf harm of any kind isn't going to be cured immediately it takes hard work and finding other healthy things to replace the self harm actions. I think most people especially professionals accept that self harmers self harm - nothing that they say can stop you if you really want to do it - only you have the power. Most people who self harm think they are bad or pathetic afterwards but actually we are not we have just found a way to cope at crappy times and there is nothing wrong with that. It just means you are doing the best you can with the limited skills you have. What engaging with CMHT can do is help you to develop some other skills instead of always heading for the self harm but as with everything you've got to want to not do it.There are people out there who go their whole lives self harming and never tell a soul because it works for them.""",,None

I could'nt make eye contact with men or with people in authority when I was younger and in my 20's, I was an extreamly hypersensitive person. Doctors and dentists scared me really bad. I ended up with a good female doctor that could relate to me more, over time I was able to trust her to speak openly and without worry, I had her for 15 years.

I used to admit to suicidal thoughts to the psychiatrist sometimes and he wouldn't do a thing, and the GP asked once and i told him and he said well that is your choice, and did nothing. Many professionals aren't too bothered by it as it is so common, unless your GP is prone to panic. It is only when they think there is serious risk to life that they will act, unless they are the panicking type and don't understand the difference between suicidal thoughts and self harm, and suicide itself.

It doesn't lessen how bad you feel and how much you want to die, it just means you can handle the thoughts and have the strength to deal with them, that you obviously want to live.

I don't know if that can be done in britain but my boys have don't that here at times. If they know you are not suicidal and really want help they may do it for you. Then they might let you go back on medications to help your anxiety/and depression and help you get feeling better. They will only keep you long enough to make sure the medications are working and let you go home. You could arrange to have your meds doled out through a family member if they are worried about you having an OD. I really believe your in a place you can't handle functioning on your own, your depression is consuming your every waking moment and you are having such a hard time finding hope right now. I know this is similar probably what you've already been told and that you are resistant from fear of past experience, but really a week or two in hospital can't be any worse, than you struggling with sh and this severe depression all alone every day, week after week. They don't restrain you unless you really try to harm yourself, someone else,try to escape, or are violent with other patients and staff.

It\'s kind of a balance. Here in Holland they make you fill in \'signalling reports\' where you write down a set of traffic lights of personal symptoms, like these symptoms means ""green"", ie early warning signs, these mean ""yellow"", meaning you need to be careful, and these mean ""red"", meaning you should be contacting services. They go into your file and stay there. It\'s meant to force you to think about the stages of your condition, and when you need to involve others.If you don\'t want it to happen again - ie accidentally triggering them to call an assessment on you - you\'ll need to be careful in your wording when you talk to them, and maybe you want to think about writing something similar for yourself, so you can recognise a dangerous situation and take responsibility yourself for calling in help when you really need it.'",,Doh

With lots of therapists, psychiatrists and gp's being 95% honest is important. The other 5% is what I call 'shading the truth', being sure that what you're saying is actually being perceived correctly. Sometimes the plain truth is still a misrepresentation of what's actually happening, and you may need to bend it a little. Something similar is true of trust. If you ever get to a psychotherapist, trusting her is going to be very important, because it's key to the therapeutic relationship. So please keep that in mind, don't close yourself to being trusting with professionals.That's not the same as being careful. I'm always very cautious when talking to psychiatrists or people on Crisis Teams, because they do have the mandate to section you, which like you I am quite keen to avoid now and in the future. It takes a bit of work for me to open up to a therapist or doctor, it's a gradual process and I always stay a bit on the alert, but with therapists I'm happy to let it happen.Anyway we always keep learning  hope you're feeling ok lost """,lostgirl19,Doh

At the moment I don't really want to speak to any professionals or have anything to do with them (right now, hopefully that will pass.) Me too, trusting anyone is a big deal for me so to be able to trust someone as much as I did my doctor was rare there was no one else I could be that honest with. That's kind of why I am so upset, she was the one person I could properly trust. I also trusted her judgement and trusted she wanted what's best for me and didn't want admission for me.

783,2014-01-17 16:21:00,Gajolene,"b""Sounds like your doctor must of been very concerned for you to recommend against what she knows you wanted. That's not a reason not to trust her. At least you can start into therapy now. Did they reccomend any medication for you to help you deal with the depression? Sorry I've slept in really late, just only woke up at 11:30. my silly cats kept me up half the night again. Take the therapy for sure, they can help you change ways of thinking of yourself, they can help you figure out why you feel the way you do about yourself, to be more accepting of yourself and finding positives in yourself. Utimately it is up to you to decide if you want to learn though. To decide to really fight off this illness and be an active participant in your recovery. If you keep refusing all the help people are giving or they are offering nothing is going to help you get better. I often wish, wish, wish soooo much that I had sought help when I was young, it would of saved me many, many years of feeling like you and not being able to tell anyone about it. I always knew feeling those feelings weren't right but I had no idea how to feel any other way or what it was I was doing wrong. Therapy isn't about telling you what to do, It is about helping you find yourself when your feeling so lost, Giving you tools you can use to help you cope in overwhelming situations, it also help you to see positives in yourself. It opens up you mind to new possibilities you hadn't thought of before, and when you start to see those possibilities you start to regain hope and confidience in yourself. You'll start believing in your abilities again and finding ways to trust. Keep posting LG talk therapy is a huge help, and I'm glad at least you can trust us here a little enough to tell us whats going on, and to listen to the good advice people are giving you here.

I also don't want help from the CMHT or any of them by the way, i didn't ever find them helpful. They got me through some bad episodes of illness, some crisis times, but now i don't feel i need them. I've had counselling though, just for six months and then i left, i don't like relying on anyone becase i don't feel anyone is trustworthy enough to rely on when ill, i daren't put all my eggs in one basket incase they don't take care of them. Routine really does help. You wake up and know what you are going to do that day. A course, a class, the gym, a walk around the park, i have something to do on every day and i can keep going knowing that that is there.Mindfullness helps me appreciate life when i'm feeling as though i don't want to be alive. It is hard to find a purpose for living sometimes. Using your senses to try and appreciate everything - a bath, eating and drinking, wind on your face, just snatching those little sensory moments can occupy your mind and make you appreciate living, it helps with the suicidal thoughts.Distraction. For me this is colouring. There is a lot of shit in my head and no doubt yours. Lots of unconscious troubles as well as conscious. Colouring or anythig creative gets you into a flow, baking works too, you become engrossed in what you are doing and all of those thoughts gently and slowly sort themselves out. You can think without getting panicked.But suicidal plans, that is a whole different ball game. Suicidal plans require medication or help from the services.

Our brains are tricky, creative things\xc2\x97we know that urges have hit us and will continue to do so! Remember, having the urge come into your head is ok. It is what you do with the urge that counts. This is where STOP THOUGHT comes in. You can practice being mindful, keeping watchful for the point at which the urge comes into your head. When you see it, use the STOP THOUGHT technique to stop it in its tracks. When the negative thought enters your head, your response is to refuse to entertain the thought. The process is:1. Recognize negative thought/urge.2. Think: STOP THOUGHT! See the big capital letters, black on a white background.3. Focus on something else right away.4. If the thought comes back to you, repeat as necessary.Here is an example.It is 5:15 pm and you are stuck in rush hour. You had a rotten day at work andthe children are hungry and stuck in the back seat. You are stuck, and today, youhave had it up to here. You think, \xc2\x93That\xc2\x92s it, that\xc2\x92s enough. Today it\xc2\x92s enough,and when I get home, I don\xc2\x92t care. As soon as I walk through that door I amjust\xc2\x97\xc2\x931. (you realize that you are getting cross and about to give yourself permission to drink tonight)2. STOP THOUGHT3. You change the radio station and start to sing along. (DIVERT) When you focus on the radio, you quit thinking about the urge. You defeat the urge by DIVERTing.This works for fifteen minutes and then your youngest daughter begins to whine.Your two oldest children are starting to get rowdy in this confined space. It israining hard, and there is no sign of the traffic letting up. You will be late anddinner will be late. \xc2\x93That\xc2\x92s it,\xc2\x94 you think, \xc2\x93surely I have had enough bad day now. Iwant to relax now. When I get home\xc2\x97\xc2\x931. (you realize you are about to give yourself permission to drink tonight)2. STOP THOUGHT3. You take a deep breath and look out the window and you refocus. You really look at the cars, the way the car door fits into the body, the shape of the trunks. Bring your shoulders down as far as you can. You holler at the personification of the urge. (DISARM) When you get mad at the urge and tell it that it has no power over you, you feel in control. You defeat the urge by DISARMing.Remember, this is your tool, so you can modify it. You can say NOOOOOOOO instead of STOP THOUGHT. You can see a stop sign instead of the words, or a big X. You can add to your STOP THOUGHT as much as you like: add, \xc2\x93HA! Ain\xc2\x92t going there, not me, no way.\xc2\x94 Whatever works for you is ok as long as the STOP takes place.The process is simple. As you learn to be mindful, you can incorporate STOP THOUGHT into your arsenal. With practice, patience, and persistence, you will find it easier and easier to use this mini-tool to your advantage'",,Lurking

Something a lot of us have had to do whether we liked it or not. Your not a child any more LG and nobody can just fix this for you, but meds and therapy helps, It can help and if you keep avoiding it, you will not be able to break out of this negative cycle and depression,and this habbit of victimizing yourself. You want to survive this and get better. Do you want to become a survivor and stop being a victim? If you do you really have to take the steps necessary to get yourself stable emotionally and get that help, to do that. You CAN do this.You need to be very honest with yourself on this and start accepting help even if you can't see how it will help right now. Please Please do this for yourself we are all so worried about you and even more worried when you don't post. We are praying you will take the advice sooo many people have given you, accept the help and aim to get yourself to a better place. Huge huge hugs and sorry if I sound too much like a nagging mum I'm only trying to help.""",,Lurking

896,2014-01-21 18:21:00,Gajolene,"b""Your not annoying anyone, we are worried because a lot of us have been in that dark place where we felt no one would ever understand or be able to help, been in that depression that never seems to go away, felt weak and worthless, and somehow that we were bad. Felt life was always going to be crappy.We know from our own experiences with depression, we know that we probabbly never would of been able to break out from depression if we hadn't accepted help, or gone into hospital for a short while. It is frustrating to us that we can't help you see yourself that you can learn to be a strong, confident, beautifull young lady. That you feel a short stay hospital can't help, when we know it can.Wouldn't it be great to be able to trust you are doing the right thing and to be able to feel proud yourself to know that you are fighting depression, and not listening to the negative things that depression tells you.""",,Lurking
