Sometimes I've felt that drinking helps the situation sometimes it hinders. I hope it helped you escape for a bit. Tho the mental health providers will want you to stay away from the booze.I don't know what country most of ya'll are from? I'm in the USA.I'm new to this forum and would like to give encouragement to you! Hopefully you woke up today and you feel better. Since its Monday hopefully these stupid crisis workers will get with it! ARGH! Ticks me off too!Ya'll seem to be a great sisterhood! I think that is wonderful. I don't know what a lot of the verbage is that ya'll write about?? Remember if you have a hangover ladies to drink lots of water. If you ever drink again drink water with it.It helps keep you hydrated which is the problem with drinking cuz it dehydrates us and that's what makes the headache. ssoda crackers work well for nausea.I know that is the least of your problems. Its very disconcerting to have the voices. sounds like you need a med change?? overall I've been satisfied with my injection of invega but its 300.00 a mos. and cannot afford it anylonger so going back on Risperdal. ughAntiphychotics if you get on the right one really can help you.

58,2013-07-06 12:15:00,pepecat,"b""There is, unfortunately, a sort of ''buyer beware' with therapy, in that it may well leave you feeling worse initially before it gets better. My therapist did warn me of that at the start of mine, but me being me, it took about 18 months before i really started opening up and talking about stuff, so for me the last year was really hard. It does get better though. I think there's a point where old defences and coping mechanisms are kinda being opened up and dismantled a bit, but the new ways of managing aren't quite concrete enough, so there is a period where you feel all over the place. My therapist said it's part of the process, and a sign that real change is happening. It's not unusual at all, and decent therapists should know about it, warn you about it, and be able to keep you safe while the therapy is happening - i.e by not rushing things and being able to handle whatever you tell them, and be able to 'contain' you and your emotions during the process. Can you contact your therapist in between sessions if you need to? I know you've only had the first one, but when things got really tricky for me, my therapist said i could call her if i was feeling wobbly. I did it twice, and it really helped. I know they don't generally like to encourage that (contact in between sessions) but sometimes it is appropriate. Could you tell your therapist in the next session how you've been feeling in between? It might get them to slow down a bit and take it a bit more gently - they shouldn't really push you too hard at the start as they need to see where you're at and build the relationship.

He didn't say I could contact between sessions, but I am seeing my s.w. on Monday so will talk to him I think and also say on Friday that maybe we could take it a little more slowly. Part of it was me, I started to tell him about my voices etc and then he asked the questions.

I've been where you are many and many a time! I wish Ihad a magic wand like Lucretia to wave over you and make you feel better. All I have is what I have experienced. Life can be really hard sometimes... well for many a lot of times. For me I find coloring with 144 crayons or some such can soothe me, listening to non vocal music that is not symphony helps me, sitting on my back patio listening to the birds and the gurgling water from my fountain help before the day gets away from me in nice weather anyway, I had an inside fountain that was really small that I used to listen to too, unless that is trigger because of tub, ummm going for a walk indoors in a mall and just ignoring everyone else and doing window shopping, buying a small portion of food I love just for the day, putting vaporub or sucking a lemon or lime wake me right up..., ....That's all I can think of... When I go to the shopping center (don't know what they call that in UK) I go to the parfume counters and try and get free samples. They usually are always glad to give you some.Life is frustrating! Sometimes if you can play the 15 mins. game.... You clock 15 mins. and say you will go at least 15 mins. without doing sh and then once you get to that 15 mins. you clock another 15 mins. and so on and so forth.

His telling me don\'t tell ""It\'ll kill your mother"" led me to a lifetime of hiding it every time I had s abuse, You were a child, you were a victim, we cannot at young ages comprehend what love involving s is, especially if like me you had a disfunctional family where critisizm is rampant and nurturing almost non existant.The flashbacks when they first hit me felt like a freight train of sickness in the pit of my stomach, they were so disjointed and relentless with the emotional connection you feel with everyone that hits. Try to think of it like a huge jigsaw puzzle with every flashback you add another peice to the full puzzle, the more pieces you add the slower the flashbacks will be, and the clearer you will understand about yourself.They won\'t be this way forever and you will gain full recall. Don\'t hate yourself for loving him back you didn\'t know any better, children will do anything to love and for the love of their parents, even when their parents are their abusers. Try to be patient with yourself. You will get through this and it will get better.

I have my voices going crazy and all the while I just want some kind of peace. I have tried sitting with the voices, they are driving me wild.

298,2014-01-05 16:27:00,Gajolene,"b""I felt the emotional flatness to, without knowing it I had dissaociated and buried emotions for so many years I really wasn't capable of feeling anything but sorrow, and pain, for myself and for the life of me I couldn't understand why. It was something that as a child and throughout my first 30yrs I somehow had learned to automatically lock away. When my first PTSD episodes hit, even though previously I had remembered the abuses I had never emotionally connected with them, they were vaugue recollections I would automatically shut off emotionally, give my head a shake and continue on. When the flashbacks hit, I would get so overwhelmed by huge flashes of emotion, 100 times what one would normally feel, It was like a grieving process only for myself, the flashebacks I couldn't turn off, rather than simple recall of an event like watching a tv show would trigger these massive emotional rememberance waves, sorrow was total despair, anger became rage, and so on.With the flashbacks things suddenly started to make sense, why I had misdirected all negative towards myself, why I hadn't been able to feel true emotions for so long. I wish I could describe it better, I wasn't in any therapy at the time and had not seen any doctors. The flashbacks came on fast, first one or two at day or in my dreams, then dramatically increased over the weeks till they were every few minutes of the day. I was sure at the time I had lost my mind. One particular event was the root of everything, the beginnings of a lifetime of disfunctional thinking and dissacociated feelings. When that flashback was complete, it completed the memory puzzle like an epiphany everything suddenly made perfect sense, but the PTSD symptoms lasted several years even after the full recall. I still have periods of anxiety/ panick and depression. I did quite a lot of cbt and rebt though online courses, and eventually with the advice of people like the ones on here did seek a therapist eventually where we delved into some scema based therapy as well. It seems my emotions go from one extream or another even now, I go from extream hypersensitivity in times of anx to flatness with depression. I hope some of you can relate and my experiences can help to some degree. At least I learned now where to place my emotions, and to put them where they belong when they do come rather than reflect everything inward as I programed myself to do as a child. Hope this helps.""",,Lurking

Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain. And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy; And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields. And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief. Much of your pain is self-chosen. It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self. Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity: For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen, And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.\xc2\x94 \xe2\x80\x95 Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet'",,Lonely

Try and look after yourself at the moment whilst you are going through this. You said about s. abuse, about it repeating, i was molested by two different people about three years apart. The second person did it about six times. I kept letting it happen. I think vulnerable people, naive people, people without much confidence or stregth, do somehow let it repeat. I don't know why. I have my own theory about why i was so, i want to say stupid but i will say vulnerable. Obviously what you went through was worse than what i went through. Any violation is heartbreaking though and so i do understand on some small level how you feel. I think i probably had something tattooed on my forehead also. A sitting duck.

I know of people who have smelt rotting flesh. Very scarey. I feel like the key to everything, the solution to everything, is self-kindness. It may not be that way for everyone, but for me that is what helps. You said you weren't sure what the good things were. I think they are the small things that comfort you or make you feel content, occupied, soothed. Some of mine are buying loose tea, different types, and trying them. I particularly like jasmine pearls. The fragrance is amazing, and i feel like i am being healed on the inside. I also buy things like dark chocolate, the bitter taste, just a small piece, it is a comfort, a sensation. Last night i coloured to classicfm. It occupied me for about half an hour. Memories came, sad thoughts came, but i also felt some pleasure seeping through. trying to eat mindfully helps. I also have a bath and then get straight in bed and lay there for ten minutes. It is so soothing, snuggly. These little things help i find. I'm sure there are some things that help you through.Sorry if im teaching a granny to suck eggs.

I also drown out the voices with loud happy music and sing at the top of my lungs. If that fails I go in the hot shower and scream out my pain. Then when I can control myself I call or text a friend for words of encouragement I hope you can find some coping mechanisms that will be helpful to you to get through these very traumatic times but know we as a forum group are always here to support you\xef\xbf\xbd\xef\xbf\xbd'",,None

757,2015-01-30 16:10:00,Gajolene,"b""Oh Keepsafe, I'm so so sorry your going through this with the hallucinations, and the voices right now. Do you have any family support right now. Are you in with the hearing voices groups at all? Hope it passes soon for you and you can stay off. But if you feel your in danger don't hesitate to get yourself back into hospital. I must say you sound very lucid for someone going through so much at the moment? You sound like you have full insight into whats going on with you.Huge huge huge hugs.""",,Lurking
758,2015-01-30 16:19:00,keepsafe,"b""Thanks - I tend to lose insight a lot but right now I feel like a lucid dreamer.My SW very worried about me, I don;t have any family support no. I have the crisis team though. I am shovelling tablets down my neck to sedate me, thats all I seen capable of right now in regards to my actions.I am very self aware at the moment and that's the problem.KSxxxx""",,Angelic
759,2015-01-30 16:32:00,Gajolene,"b""I think even though it's really bad, that the fact you know what is going on is a good thing, because you can rationalize whats happening in reality. If JD is off his meds all insight goes out the window and he has no idea how dangerous he is with himself and his family. Literally he lives in his lucid dream state or as I call it his other realities and there are many with him. Is there a friend you can call to check in on you? Very worried, keep posting here at least so maybe we can see the warning signs if things are getting to out of control and we can see it but you can't. We can signal you when we think it's gone to far and you need immediate help.""",,Lurking
