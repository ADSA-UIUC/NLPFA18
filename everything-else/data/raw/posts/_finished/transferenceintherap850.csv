I can kinda see that it is, but what no one tells you is how bloody awful it makes you feel.All those unresolved feelings / emotions / whatever from when you were a kid, all opened up again to be worked through with someone who can't be a parent to you, wont ever be - and that's ok - it's not their job, and frankly it would just be....well....weird.

You have to find your own way to deal with these emotions, be it your own coping mechanisms or ones suggested to you by the therapist. By no means its easy, I still suffer with the raw emotions too and I have been out of therapy for nearly a year and a half. I do have my own coping mechanisms but sometimes do not have the ability to use them.You must stay strong and believe, by no means therapy is the end of it all - I think its a life long battle and we all get it wrong a lot of the time.Please stay safe and wellKSxxxxx'",,Angelic

Last session was a really tough one and i left with feeling proud of what i'd achieved (a very alien feeling) and overwhelmed with negative thoughts at the same time...since then my time off has gone downhill and i dont have a therapy session til the 23rd now and thats going to be the start of a really tough lot of therapy sessions (even more tough than the others as looking at self hatred) so im not looking forward to that. 50 mins really is not enough, my sessions nearly always overrun and we have to 'save' something for the following week usually too.

Maybe I haven\'t got to that bit yet.All I would say is that therapy seems to go in peaks and troughs, and no there never is enough time - particularly if you are an older participant.

7,2012-10-14 19:05:00,pepecat,"b""As far as i understand it (which probably isn't all that far!) transference is kinda the redirecting of emotions etc from childhood towards someone else. Hopefully in a therapy setting, the emotions get a chance to be worked out / resolved properly in a safe place, when they might not have been when we were kids, which is probably why we ended up in therapy in the first place! Basically it's sort of 'playing out' (though i don't mean that term lightly at all) emotions etc that we experienced in childhood, in a safe place where no one will tell us off for being angry or upset or scared or whatever. It means we can experience and then work through those emotions and stuff can get mended.I suppose it's like if you didn't feel particularly loved or understood by a parent (often a mother, how typical....!!) then than need to be loved and understood and 'parented' goes unmet and you have this longing for that. In therapy then, you can start to see the therapist as a sort of parent figure, in that you feel understood by them and safe with them. So you 'transfer' your feelings for a parent figure to your therapist. Apparently it's all perfectly normal in certain types of therapy, including the one i'm doing. And it is something that should be brought up and talked about, cos working through it is an important part of things as well. My therapist has been totally unsurprised by it all with me - it's a recognised part of the process of therapy. Some therapists (usually inexperienced ones) don't handle a client's transferring stuff all that well, but most have been trained in how to deal with it and are aware of it and how it works. I suppose if you're working with people who are distressed, vulnerable, lonely, scared etc, and you offer them a safe place and listen to them and don't judge / criticise, then it's no wonder clients start seeing you as a special person in their lives.""",MissKitty,Pensive

I remember saying to my therapist a few weeks back that i felt all edgy and angry and i didn't know what to do with that, and she said 'why do you need to do anything with it?'.Her point was that if you're feeling happy you don't question it and wonder what to do with it, so why should you with 'negative' emtions. I see what she means, and i suppose it is about learning to feel and live with less pleasant emotions. I don't know how to do that yet though......""",MissKitty,Pensive

Does your cpn know you're angry? You seem to be aware that it's not directed specifically at her but it's at other people / things. Guess she's the one you feel safe enough with to let it out?

I am totally floored by the impact of this and the discoveries about myself. At the beginning of therapy when we talked about core beliefs and my therapist suggested, "" I am vulnerable"" as one of mine, I scoffed at him and told him that he could not be more wrong. Ten months later I\'m feeling wiped out by vulnerability. How do they know that right at the beginning, when you don\'t even realise yourself?Also Pepecat, can you tell me, have you got to the stage where you feel totally humbled and almost empty, at rock bottom almost? I felt like that a week or so ago, and I was told by someone else they felt like that half way through therapy too.

16,2012-10-14 21:30:00,pepecat,"b""It's weird isn't it?! I think, if it's an experienced therapist you have, that they have probably seen it all before, so have a fairly good idea of what's going on. That's not to say that people's experiences are trivial or mundane, cos they're not at all, but i wonder, in the whole scope of humanity, if people are actually all that different after all. I imagine it's fairly similar stuff that affect us, once you get down to it. Of course people are all different and it all manifests itself in different ways but i reckon there's probably quite a small list of things that can constitute the heart of most people's issues. My therapist left me feeling like i'd been emotionally xrayed by her on more than one occasion. It freaked me out rather a lot, but she said that in a sense she had to see to the core of things fairly quickly in order to make an assessment as to whether to take me on in the first place, and then to get a handle of what was going on. We did go more slowly once we started proper, but it was very disconcerting how easily they see through all the (so called) good defences we put up.I don't know.......in answer to your question, i mean. I think i realised i needed to change before i started therapy. I felt rock bottom when i was ill, and i've never felt that bad since. I've felt bad, but in a different way, in therapy. I think....in therapy, that you gradually get to the point where you don't care what the therapist thinks any more - you know you won't be judged or criticised - and you can just let it all come out (so to speak).

The core beliefs thing that we started with comes down to a list of pretty basic human instincts which are linked to being loved, safe and looked after I think.

I also realised how empty my life had become and how little there was left when the anxiety issues were stripped away and I had to stand back. Big truths are very hard and totally gutting.

I don't think that would be a 'gutting' sort of truth, but it would make us reappraise things and look at ourselves in a different light, which can be hard if we've seen ourselves one way for many years. Then there are the gutting truths where we might have deluded ourselves (for good reason) about how we are or how we think we are, and we have to face the fact that actually we're not like that, which can totally pull the rug from under us. Or the truths which aren't exactly bad, but we don't necessarily want to admit - like the fact that we do need other people, and do feel horribly lonely and scared.

Bizarrely, that need for someone to sort it all out for me, has gone back into proportion again since. Don\'t know why.....maybe the ""tough love"" did me some good.You\'re not pathetic or needy or stupid....far from it! Try to reason it out in your head. You are simply very anxious about what ""might"" happen......and this experience has probably shown you that s/harming didn\'t solve the problem and the ""reassurance"" that the phone call brought was probably only temporary.Let the anxiety flow over you and do it\'s worst.....then tell yourself ""nothing terrible happened and I survived""..... because other than the self harm, the events all panned out to be OK didn\'t they? And it was your fear of coping that caused you to self harm and reach out for help.Hope that makes sense. Like I said I\'ve never self harmed so I am probably not completely aware of how hard it is to stop, so apologies if I sound too simplistic. However, anxiety has made me feel desperate and suicidal and once I got to that place of feeling incapable of coping without contemplating suicide I found that feeling became the feeling that I resorted to each time I felt desperately anxious. (apologies for the long complicated sentence.) It was that feeling that I had to realise was doing me and my family no good at all and STOP it in it\'s tracks! I was surprised how easy it was to realise that nothing was worth dying for, and that I had to find the strength to deal with things instead of being paralysed by fear.Keep trying. This is fear....nothing more than that. You have to find another way to cope and believe in your ability to manage. You will.Good luck tomorrow Pepecat.x'",,Confused

And she rang me back after about 10 minutes. Scared the life out of me! I think the idea is i get past thinking that needing help is wrong / stupid / pointless etc, but it's hard to do that. It's ingrained........ Normally i wouldn't dream of ringing her outside of sessions - i get my 50 mins a week and that's it (in my head), so i can kinda see her point.......She did reassure me in the phonecall, and it did help..... but then i got really angry with myself that i needed to make the call. Hence the s/h. Once i can deal with stuff without thinking i'm stupid / awful etc for having emotions (including anxiety) or needing some help, i'll be fine. She says.....

52,2013-01-08 09:50:00,MissKitty,"b'Hi again,Therapy went well thanks.....actually reduced down to once p/fortnight to allow for some ""cope alone"" time. That\'s progress!Hmmm.....that\'s quite a difficult situation isn\'t it? Needing to acknowledge that it\'s OK to have emotions, show them and reach out to people....but at the same time now having to stop seeing the person that you have made all this progress with. Presumably you can now do all those things in therapy? You just need to transfer it all to real life?I think most of us find the ""weaker"" emotions difficult to show. For example I\'m sad about what has happened to my health, but it comes out as anger in many situations which often causes conflict, problems and people to turn against me. On the few occasions that the sadness has shown it\'s face instead I have gained far more sympathy and understanding....but it\'s not the emotion I choose to express, because it conveys weakness and makes me feel vulnerable and exposed. Anger is my default setting and that\'s been hard to change. It helps to know where it comes from and why it\'s there. I can see that you\'ve begun to lay out some of your emotions in this thread - expressing your vulnerability and fears. Does it help to express them and to see that people don\'t avoid you or critique you as a result?You also mention a partner? Can you express your emotions / vulnerability to him/her? He / she would perhaps be a good person to rely on in place of your therapist as you move towards concluding therapy?I wonder whether that relationship could be developed in therapy to help ease you forward and out into the real world again?Just a thought, maybe your relationship is already close and confiding, and this isn\'t necessary....but either way it seems to me that this person would be a good substitute for your therapist if the relationship is a serious one and on solid ground. What do you think?x'",,Confused
53,2013-01-08 22:06:00,pepecat,"b'That sounds good! Do you feel ok about that?Yep, that\'s the general idea i think.... i still swing wildly between \'emotions are all crap and pointless and stupid\' to being open with her and ok with it. I need to find some middle ground somehow. And it feels safe with her, but not with other people so much, and that\'s also something i need to figure out. Yeah, i get that i think. Thank you for being so honest. I think my default setting is.... well it\'s not no emotion really, but it\'s pushing down emotion and not acknowledging it and thinking i don\'t need it. That\'s my default. Like you, i don\'t like expressing (any) emotion, especially not the weaker ones, cos i do feel very vulnerable and exposed. Don\'t like it!It does! A lot, actually. It feels like a safer place to \'practice\' being a bit more open with things. And i always find it easier writing than talking to people face to face. It\'s a bit more detached that way. And not knowing people on here kinda helps as well, so in a way i\'m not asbothered about embarassing myself. The thread seems to have become a bit of a journal!Yes, again, I can talk to her, though also again i don\'t find it all that easy. I kinda have to force myself and persist with it. We\'ve been together 10 years, so you\'d think it would be ok..... I think i\'m getting slightly better at it, but i\'m always consious that she\'s got stuff going on, and i don\'t want to be a pain or for her to worry about me.... which is something else i need to figure out!I""m sure i\'ll get there eventually.

It was kinda weird...... cos of the break over christmas, and she didn't seem at all surprised that i'd been so up and down. Telling her about the s/h was hard though and in the end i just blurted it out cos she was asking how i'd been feeling in between christmas and new year. And she wasn't cross, or disappointed...... i thought she would be. She was also glad that i'd rung her. Not glad cos i was upset, but glad that i'd actually reached out and gone 'help!' for once. I just find all this opening up thing SO hard......it's...... painful - that's the only way i can describe it - and not only emotionally; it's a physical feeling as well (which sounds weird, I know) but it makes me want to run away, or curl up in a ball so no one can get to me, but at the same time i recognise it is worthwhile, ultimately.""",,Pensive
56,2013-01-10 13:19:00,MissKitty,"b'My therapy was like that too. We ended up chatting more than anything else and catching up. It\'s interesting reading your posts because it turns out that you are the complete opposite to me. I open up way too much and don\'t think twice about confiding my concerns and worries. This is often abused by people and has caused me much angst because I never see it coming. It\'s also the situation I was in when I had my heart spasms, so now when I say too much I panic, thinking I\'ll be taken advantage of, and the slightest indication that it is happening makes me terrified.....and yet still I talk too much through increased anxiety. Vicious circle - hence therapy!My irritatingly always right, husband does it well. He takes his time, considers people and uses his judgement wisely. He edits what he says to fit the situation and never tells anyone anything that could be used against him. He discloses little and listens a lot, and never offers an opinion unless asked for one. Oh, I am so not worthy!!....such self control! Why can\'t I do that? However, I doubt your issue is a lack of discretion, or too much of it. I imagine it\'s something to do with people getting too close...intimacy?....or just not brought up to say how you feel / never got listened to / put down / discredited perhaps? Has your therapy got to the bottom of it? And do you feel comfortable enough to disclose it..... probably not on the main forum unless it\'s pretty bland I imagine. Maybe that\'s an appropriate subject for discretion....what makes us tic is difficult for most of us to come out with!The feelings you describe do sound painful. The phrase ""pulling teeth"" comes to mind. It may sound simplistic, but maybe just doing it more and making yourself do it may be the best way to crack it. If I was you I think I\'d start with your partner and build it up from a rehearsed routine to a point where it becomes natural. I was thinking about this the other day and came up with a little plan for you.. It\'s not based on anything scientific ....it\'s just a few ideas that have come from some of the therapy I\'ve had.....feel free to ignore. It\'s probably utter rubbish but I\'ll tell you anyway:1. Draw a line with a centre point. This represents a continuum. Label one end ""Constantly whinging and wailing"" and the other end ""Absolute emotional restraint"". The mid point could be labelled ""ideal"" depending on where you think ideal is.2. Once you\'ve established where your ""ideal"" point would be, (e.g. my husband\'s would be east of centre and mine would be way to the west,) mark it and label it with the type of behaviours that you would consider ideal and that you would like to achieve for yourself. Your aims if you like.3. With your partner agree a staged plan. Incorporate tiny incremental steps and milestones with rewards. Mark each of them on your line / continuum. It will seem really silly initially but some ground rules might help.An example would be:Set aside 15-30 mins p/day for this, or every 2 days / every week if that\'s more comfortable....but it\'s important that you do it and that you both agree that this is ""You time"". It will serve as a replacement for therapy in time. Each step is numbered below and you can stay on each step for as long as you need to. No pressure!Here are the steps - feel free to change to suit / ignore:1. When you feel an important* emotion, remember it and write it down. When you see your partner tell her how you felt. She must agree to listen and not judge. She cannot ask you to divulge any more than you want to tell her and she must listen without distractions. Reward: Hug and dedicated time. *Important means that it matters to you / no one else!2. Repeat step 1 again but this time, write down some more information. E.g. situation, what it was and how it made you feel. Share the situations with your partner. She must listen, not judge and empathise only. It\'s important that you feel listened to and respected for confiding.Reward: Hug or something nice....chocolate? Note: For steps 1 & 2, add some time afterwards for talking about guilt / shame / fear / weakness or any emotions that emerge afterwards. Your partner must listen and tell you honestly how it makes her feel when you open up to he. The aim is to reassure you that she is pleased you have confided and tried so hard. 3. Find an event or instance that prevokes a strong emotion, (maybe from the past, or one that is current) The emotion should be one that might cause you to self harm or feel really bad about yourself. Explain the events surrounding it and say as much as you comfortably can. Express the emotion physically if this is easier - tears, hugging, banging the wall etc. Your partner must listen and not judge. Work on this step until you can divulge the entire thing. Reward: Hug and something very nice as a treat and a thank you for trusting. Note: Remember to deal with any resulting guilt / fear / shame etc. after step 3Again your partner must tell you honestly how your opening up to her made her feel. The aim should be to remove any of your resulting negative feelings.4. Step 3 might go on quite a bit, particularly if there are events you need to discuss that are significantly difficult for you to express....but persist.5. Work towards expressing emotion in a more spontaneous way. Do this in the evenings and weekends when you are both around. This will be difficult sometimes, due to external pressures and where you are, so guage how much it is appropriate to say at the time you feel the emotion, but state it anyway. Your partner should encourage you to express it then and there. However, if the timing is difficult for intimate talking, agree to talk about it later during your ""you time""....but don\'t bottle it up. Reward: Hug or similar each time.6. Keep up the ""you time"" on a weekly / bi-monthly basis for as long as you need it. In time convert this to a regular thing like going out to dinner for a date to talk honestly to each other about how you feel, and what\'s been building up emotionally. At this point you\'re on a par with the rest of the population and better than most.7. Extend this to close friends / family as deemed appropriate for you. Maybe use some of my husband\'s guidelines to determine whether confiding is appropriate. I expect you\'ll be very good at this!Would this help maybe? Bit contrived but the ""you time"" needs to be there I think, and it might help you move away from therapy and develop more intimacy in your relationship. Sorry if I\'ve overstepped the mark.x'",,Confused
57,2013-01-10 21:46:00,pepecat,"b""Oh not good - i can see how that would go round and round...... I guess though, if you're aware of it now (or at least how / why you do it) that it helps? Or has it made you more anxious now you're aware? I suppose it's quite a fine line between giving us enough knowlesge about ourselves, but not letting it freak us out too much!Pretty much, yes. Being brought up feeling like having feelings wasn't important, or feeling dismissed therefore there's no point in having feelings cos they're not really acknowledged..... that kinda thing. Oh aye, therapy has gotten to the bottom of it. She was there way before i was..... Took me a long time to open up to her, but she pretty much had me sussed at the start. Obviously not the ins and outs of it, but a fair idea of what was going on. Yeah i think that is the way to go. And i have been trying to do that, and take little risks with other people i feel safe with - friends and that, i mean. And actually, nothing bad has happened so far. I guess there's always that little voice in my head going 'what if'.... or 'but it might' (go wrong). You know, i was talking to my partner the other day and trying to tell her how important and significant the whole therapy thing has been for me - i can't describe it properly, it's too...... big, and i don't know how to get that across. But anyway.... i was saying that after therapy ends, i feel like i will always need a sort of space / person like that. I don't mean therapy all the time, that would be weird, and actually not helpful; but i guess having a safe space, or time, and person with whom i can say stuff - no matter what it is - but just explore things and be emotional if i need to, is important. I don't even think it would have to be a regular, scheduled thing..... but i don't know how to go about finding that. My partner suggested something a bit like your plan - to find time once a week where we just have a chat about stuff. Then we said maybe it could be a place instead, so if I said 'lets go to x' then she'd know i want to talk. I think that could work, and if we were out walking it's easier to talk to someone than if you're face to face with them in a sitting down sort of way. I liked your plan. It's helpful and i think would be a good thing to do - and to figure out where i'd liek to be on the 'talking to people' scale.

Having said that if therapy was tough this week and you feel drained...maybe that in itself was a good test for you. Would you normally s/harm after a tough session?It\'s interesting that you think the symbolic thing would work, because you would think of her each time. Is that because you don\'t want to let this lady down? That fits in with the feelings of attachment we\'ve been discussing....but I\'m probably making assumptions. If you could imagine her disapproval each time you go to s/harm might that work in the future? Or would it simply add to feelings of self hate, disgust etc to be disapproved of? Like I said, I don\'t understand enough about s/harm to be truly useful here. I\'m grasping at straws and drawing on what other people have said about how they feel when they do it. You may be quite different.Personally, I\'d be tempted to give it to your partner when it\'s returned....as part of that devolution of responsibility from therapist to partner that we discussed.

The anxiety's ramping up at the moment though. If it's not one thing it's a-bloody-nother! I feel fairly relived that it's not here actually. And kinda reassured - in a weird way - that she has it. It's like she's sort of looking after me through it, if that makes ANY sense at all.

75,2013-01-18 09:16:00,MissKitty,"b'It sounds like you have a really good relationship with this therapist of yours. I bet she does ""hold you in her mind"" during the week, and hopes that you are doing well. She sounds very kind and understanding and it\'s encouraging that she believes in your ability to get through this and come out the other side. In the early days of my therapy I would be washed out with emotion some days and tearful for what felt like no identifiable reason. The tears felt very cleansing though although the sadness was very deep. It was weird, because it would come on and then just go away. I had no control over it seemingly.I\'ve had similar experiences with anger since starting therapy. It has come out from such depths that it has been frightening. Almost like a primal type response. Again, no control over whether it comes out or not and intense to the point of it making me shake....never felt anger like it before. My therapist told me that sadness is often the underpinning emotion for anger. Could this be true for you too? As for the anxiety have you identified reasons for it? I know it sounds simplistic but I do think that the treatment of anxiety has a great deal to do with facing up to things that we find hard...the things we fear....and building the confidence and self esteem we need to do that. That\'s very hard to do and a gradual thing....but I am entirely sure it can be done. I know it\'s my favourite phrase on here, but it\'s finding that inner steel / strength and telling yourself that you can be strong and will be. That\'s my take on it anyway...for what it\'s worth.x'",,Confused

I feel washed out pretty much every week after therapy..... and then i have to go straight to work, which is always hard. It usually takes me a couple of days to get my head round things and for things to settle down. Sometimes things do kinda hit me without warning, which is weird, like you say!Yeah, I've been feeling angrier than i normally am - not all the time, but sometimes. And more anxious, and more tearful... la la la..... She says it's all good though cos i'm learning to be 'emotional' (meaning having emotions) which is what the point of this is, pretty much. And sometimes i can't see any reason for it - it just seems to come from nowhere. I've not had anything as intense as you describe though - that sounds scary! I guess if you're aware that you feel like that it kinda helps you not to react inappropriately cos you know you're angrier than normal. Well, that's what i find anyway - i don't know if the anger you describe is something slightly different? I think.... that a lot of my anxiety - which is always of the 'what if' variety; what if x happens, what if x doesn't happen etc., - is down to a fear of not being able to cope, and probably of being abandoned and therefore having to cope in (what feels like) a scary world cos i'm on my own. So i guess it's about learning that maybe i can cope - or even that it's ok to ask people to help if i cant (like ringing her before christmas), and then i shouldn't feel so anxious.

Very sad though.As for the blame thing....children learn by example. If your parents didn't love and cuddle maybe that's why you weren't into it? People are so different and not everyone is tactile and vocal about their emotions. Do kids understand that I wonder and feel rejected, or do they just learn not to do it either? I don't know. Are your parents still alive? Can you talk to them about it perhaps? Not an easy conversation, but perhaps it helps to understand from their perspective.Sorry you're feeling so lonely and sad.

It wasn\'t anything specific that they did or didn\'t do when i was a kid - as the therapist says, it was just a mismatch between their personalities and mine. Which doesn\'t sound like anything when you hear stories of kids who are abused or neglected or whatever. Nothing like that happened, it was/is just a mismatch.I don\'t know how to talk to them about it, and i don\'t think i want to. We don\'t really talk about stuff at all in our family, and we\'re not huggy or touchy/feely really either. My mum has said in the past that \'You were such a happy baby.....\' implying \'what happened?\' and i just said \'I grew up\'. She compares me to my (younger) brother, who was much more into hugs and cuddles than i was, and i get the ""you were never into cuddles all that much\'..... so it kinda does feel like i was at fault somehow. I dunno.Like you say, people are very different in how they express emotion / love to their kids. I think kids probably do pick up on that, but perhaps don\'t understand it. They don\'t have the experience / emotional understanding TO be able to understand it, so maybe it does feel like rejection, and they learn to also keep emotions hidden, and end up miserable. Kids try to keep themselves safe, and come up with various coping mechanisms to do that - i guess keeping emotions hidden is one of them. Well it was for me, anyway.'",MissKitty,Pensive

The latter is a form of acceptance again I suppose...Do you know what therapy is trying to achieve? Or is it up to you how you deal with it?Is filling it in with self love what Roger is recommending?

I guess sometimes i feel it worse than others, and at the moment its worse. Therapy is about me realising that it's ok to have feelings and emotions, and to express them - positive and negative - and to realise that having and feeling emotions does not mean i'm stupid, or pathetic, or weak, or worthless. It's been about giving me an 'emotional life' to go alongside the 'cerebral life' which was dominant and kept emotions shut down and out of the way. It's been about other things as well, but mostly that. And i guess part of that has been going back to the bit of me that started shutting emotions away at age three or four or whatever it was, and reconnecting with that kid and letting it know that it's ok to feel sad, and have emotions, and be scared and lonely. Which is where the whole 'hole' thing comes into it.It is quite complex, yes!! And i do think people can over analyse. I have a friend who navel gazes a LOT and i'm not sure it does much (if any) good to do it quite that much. I have found though, that going through all this complex stuff has been necessary. I understand myself far better, and actually it's sort of led on to some quite simplistic thinking about what's important to me and what i need in life.

I can't describe it. It's been SO huge, and SO important for me........ and i don't want to die again when it ends...... and it's all too tied up with her, and that place, at the moment.

It is a grieving process and rightly so. You at the moment are going through an anticipatory grieving process. In some ways that is hard but in other ways in allows you to think about things you might like to still achieve, talk about what you might do when things are hard and consolidate what you have learned. That doesn't mean that each week you need to go on and on about ending as I think that can increase the agony it is rather like when a good friend tells you they are moving away, you feel massive loss as perhaps abandonment but you don't talk about it every time till they leave instead you make sure that you spend time with them and do what you need to before they leave and you say good bye the last time you see them. I think therapy is much the same it is right that you should feel a loss, and it is normal to feel sad now but I guess the best way forward is to use this time and think how you want to use it I think taking things written down is a jolly good idea as it allows you a way to start discussing things again and not shut down.""",,None

129,2013-03-05 11:14:00,MissKitty,"b'Hmmm....I\'m beginning to wonder whether therapy is any use at all for the issues you have Pepecat. If it ends up making you feel attached to someone and dependant on them, it just makes it harder to face being alone all over again as it just reinforces what was originally missing. (did that make sense?)How do you balance making someone worse (being abandoned again) against keeping them in therapy and possibly deepening the attachment? (Perhaps attachment is the wrong word?) If they end up hurt, was this the right way to handle it in the first place?Also, hate to say this but if you cannot now trust other people enough to confide in them and talk, has therapy really worked for you? I know these are difficult questions....but if therapy has meant that you have been able to open up for the first time....then maybe that is what you have to be content with taking away from this for now. Maybe time and this experience will show you that you can open up to others and there are people out there you can trust with your feelings. Maybe these two years of therapy represent no more than an ""awakening"" and you cannot expect too much more of yourself just yet? As Roger said, you have to use it as a platform to move forward from and work on self development, I think.It\'s the same old story for us all in therapy....we talk, we feel supported, we listen and we learn....but ultimately we have to do it ourselves.I think you need to believe that you can do this.....but take it slowly.x'",,Confused
130,2013-03-05 18:37:00,speckles,"b""I think it is a very normal reaction to feel a great loss and bad about the ending of a relationship, it doesn't mean that it hasn't been valuable in some ways this is part of the learning process to. All the really great relationship we have in life will at some point end or involve hurt but it doesn't mean you would have been better off without them. I mean you might have a husband who dies for example and that is really hard there is lots to work through but you don't look back at the time and wished you never experienced that love. It is that love and care that shows you that you can be cared for and it does exist and you have formed a successful relationship with this person which means you can go on and do this again with others. Clearly you will look back on this special person and perhaps they may even become more special in the future because they have taught you things about care vital for a future life and thus give you the opportunity to move forward in your life, this person is not the only person who will be able to show care for you and you will meet others who you can open up and trust, but may be this cannot happen while you still see this person because your investment is there and at somepoint what she has shown you needs to have an opportunity to blossom and it can but it will take time and you will too have to grieve for that loss but at some point you will be ready to move forward. Also while you may not see her it does not mean she never thinks about you and it does not mean that care does not exist in her. Actually it is hard for them to say good bye too and they grieve. And ok you cannot contact her in the sense of support or see her but actually you can send her a letter once a year and christmas and tell her what you have achieved or are doing, just because she cannot reply does not mean she would not like to hear what you are doing, it is not inappropriate to do this and send it to her work address. (clearly if you were just writing how crap you were doing that would not be a thing to do) I know because she is the first person you have been able to do this with it feels impossible and like you being abandoned but really you are not she has re-parented you, given you some opportunities to see people differently but like a parent sometimes they have to push you out of the nest so that you can start forming these relationships, otherwise how can you form a life. Sometimes in the NHS because of money this happens a bit sooner than we are really ready for but that doesn't mean that we cannot still use the experience as a positive one in your life. However, it is normal for you not to feel that right now as just like any grieving process when something first happens you don't start thinking about a new life without them, your grieve, and then the future happens gradually as you adapt.""",,None
131,2013-03-05 23:20:00,pepecat,"b""The whole basis of the therapy i've been having has been about the attachment and the relationship to the therapist. That's kinda how it works. It does reinforce what was missing in a way - perhaps 'highlight' is a better term though - but is also supposed to (and has) mend some of what was missing. I think the idea is that, having uncovered my emotional life, and brought it more into balance with my rational life, and me tentatively 'practising' being emotional with people outside of therapy, then i carry what i learn in therapy outside into the real world. I get it, in terms of how it works, but i still struggle hugely with the old defenses popping up and wanting to squash the emotional side of me down. And of course any sort of stress / difficult time (i.e ending therapy), means the defences are apt to pop up again..... I don't feel dependent on her, just very attached (apparently completely normal), and incredibly sad about it ending. I guess cos it's not abandoning. Or shouldn't feel like it if the ending is done properly. Tentatively..... i don't think it will feel like that. I hope not anyway. Really hope not. She knows what she's about, and i hope it will be ok. I'm very scared, and very sad, but i hope it will be ok. I think it's always going to hurt. But as she said, if it didn't, then it means nothing important has been achieved, because you wouldn't care about losing it if it didn't matter. I trust some people. Maybe four or five that i can think of. Not everyone, of course, but that would be too far in the other direction. I think a lot of it comes from the fact that with therapy, you have someone who is jsut there, for you, every week, and it's your time and your space, and you can say what you like. Which i desperately needed. But of course that's not 'real life'...... And friends have their own shit to deal with, so that relationship is never replicated out in 'real life' (and maybe shouldn't be either - i don't know)....actually, in some religious settings i guess it is - talking to a priest or vicar or something maybe... but anyway, in most people's 'normal' lives, friends /partners have their own lives /crap to deal with and don't want to hear me wittering on..... not that i do it all the time anyway, but i kinda feel like i don't have the right to open up to people. That they have enough on their plate, why would they want to listen to me..... Here (forum) is different for some reason. Maybe cos it's more anonymous or something. Or people can read and chose not to respond, which a face to face friend can't do really, or they can respond hours later... i dunno. I've always found writing things easier anyway, so maybe that's why its easier on here.Yes i think that's all correct. That is what it's enabled me to do - open up to people. Heck even on here two eyars ago i wasn't as open with people... i don't think anyway. The thing to try and do is not chuck the good experiences away in the panic and sadness of ending.

And (final question) do you get on with the therapist?I can see how therapy (good therapy) can be addictive..... i have a friend who seems to be permanently in therapy - almost going from one to another.....almost like some emotional crutch..... i think there does come a point where we have to get out there and live, even if we're not sure we can. I don't mean when we're ill and in need of therapy / help, of course, but i think soemtimes there is a danger when people are generally ok and able to live but choose to keep having therapy as some sort of crutch, as i've said.Oh that's not making much sense at all........ It happens more when people go privately i think, and it's not time limited, though a good therapist should say that they think enough work has been done to let you go off and live. At the end of 'Shoot the Damn Dog' by Sally Brampton, she says her therapist (private) 'sacked her'. The therapist realised they'd done enough good stuff for her to be able to get on with life. In the NHS of course, they kick you out eventually, so they kinda need to make sure enough has been done to enable us to cope without them. I think a good therapist recognises that it can be addictive, and will help you through that, and, when the time is right, work towards ending things postively...... it's really hard though.... It is also scary as hell..... i've been thinking about this lately, and one of the scary things about digging down inside yourself is that you don't know what you're going to find, or if stuff is going to come out in one big 'whoosh' all over the place... and revealing that stuff to someone else is scary as well - what if they think we're weird or something..... But again, a good therapist will be able to handle whatever emotions come up, and be able to keep you safe and kinda 'contain' things. I told my therapist something this week that i'd been embarrassed abotu for ages, and thought was weird and messed up, and she said 'It's perfectly normal'...... well that completely threw me..... what she said about it made perfect sense and i can see how it is normal, it's jsut i'd had this thing in my head so long and thought it was weird.... and it wasn't. It is scary, and painful, and hard...... but sticking with it can be worthwhile. My therapist said last week that the fact i go there every week is in itself a big thing - it's an act of 'self care' if you like, regardless of what then gets talked about in the session. As i said previously - it's the hardest thing i've ever done, but i think probably the best thing i've done as well.""",,Pensive

I find it difficult to say if I like the therapist, to like someone is to know them and I guess a good therapist doesn't let you know them. I like his style and approach to therapy, he is firm and disagrees with me, which I like, I like to be challenged and hear other peoples opinions even if I do not necessarily agree. I also like that he mirrors how I am feeling if that makes sense? I think he is a good therapist and a number of professionals have spoken highly of him.

140,2013-03-17 22:37:00,pepecat,"b'He sounds very good - and rather like my woman... she used to challenge me and not let me away with anything, and even now will say things like \'I think you\'re lying to yourself\'. She can also make me laugh, and takes a joke as well. It takes a while for the relationship to develop - I\'ve been with my therapist just over two years, and for the first few months i didn\'t like it (or her) all that much. I thought she was out to get me and was playing hardball, which she can do (and has done), but she\'s also turned out to be really gentle with me when i need it. As you say, you never get to \'know\' the therapist in terms of stuff they like, are they married, do they have kids, etc, but i think you do get to know their personality in some part. I\'d say a good, and an experienced therapist will relate to you as a person - they don\'t become some sort of robot when they go to work. They bring their personality into the room with them - it\'s them, and it impacts on how they do therapy and relate to clients. No two therapists relate to clients in the same way. So in that sense we do kinda get to \'know\' a bit about our therapists. I don\'t know..... if you have the option to go twice a week, maybe try it for a couple of weeks and see how you go? I""m not sure i ever had the option as my therapy is through the NHS, though she did mention going twice a week for a bit before christmas when i was having a complete flip out about each and every thing. I found though that a week is about right for me \'recover\' from the session - it usually takes me at least a day or so to settle emotionally from it, and then think about and digest what we\'ve talked about.Question that occurred to me - do you keep a journal or anything of your sessions? It\'s something i do and i\'ve found it really useful becuase it helps me consolidate what we talked about in the session, think about it, process it further... and it\'s also been really helpful to be able to read back over the last two years of stuff and see progess and change, especially when i don\'t feel like i\'ve gotten anywhere. I know it\'s not everyone\'s cup of tea, but just a thought.It might well be both.... Or it might be just one... or it could change as you progess through therapy. When i started, i knew, somewhere deep down inside me, that this was something i had to do and that it was important to do it. Only as therapy has gone one have i realise just HOW important it was and how much i needed to do it - and i took me two years to say to her that i needed to be there (cos in my head i don\'t do being \'needy\', really - well... didn\'t anyway). I basically didn\'t have an emotional \'side\' of me for so long, so therapy for me has been about bringing that emotional side of me out and more in balance with that rational bit of me. At the start, i didn\'t have too much trouble shutting things off in between sessions - cos that\'s what i\'d done for so long, so it was easy. Now i find it much harder as the emotional side of me is becoming more prominent. Sometimes it\'s the stuff that we talk about during the session that is hard, sometimes its the associated emotions that brings up and then other connections which are made during the week which can be hard... it varies. If your therapist is decent (and he sounds like he is) then he\'ll help you deal with stuff that comes up, and also shouldn\'t push you too hard if he thinks you wont be able to deal with it.Oh join the club! I still get really nervous the day i go, and that\'s after years!! I\'m always a bit antsy the night before as well - it depends on what we\'ve talked about how anxious i get during the week... but i still get really nervous the day i go. It\'s nuts!You don\'t have to stitch yourself up. He\'ll help with that. Or he\'ll give you the means to stitch yourself up. That was something i was terrified of as well - i had this huge struggle between really needing and wanting to be there and talk about stuff, but terrified of what was going to come out and that i wouldn\'t be able to deal with it. My therapist once said that she wouldn\'t open me up and then abandon me - that would be cruel, and she\'s not cruel. And that\'s perfectly true. She\'s not at all, and that\'s not what therapy is about. Your chap\'s not going to unpick you - or help you unpick yourself - without being able to keep you safe and help you deal with whatever comes out, and without helping you mend as well. Because that would be cruel, and pointless. And you guy sounds like he\'s ok so wouldn\'t do that. You\'re not a loser at all.

Suppressed anger really explodes, particularly if the fuel keeps being added. It's still better out than in though....but frightening when it finally erupts.Better to just let it out and say what you want with some passion and feeling as things happen. That kind of anger is easy to deal with and makes your point at the time and in the actual situation. It's saying what you feel really isn;t it? It cleanses you and doesn't let the feelings twist and contort into something much worse.Try saying how you feel about things that annoy you or upset you first. You can even present them logically but let the feelings out. That's an expression of annoyance...and that's probably what most people with anger issues ultimately aim for as a more controlled response. It's as risk free as anger gets I'd say.Therapy's the only place to do anger without any risk at all really. Give it a try if you can locate the feelings. Or maybe it's more honest to cry?(Anyway, you're lucky, my therapist asked me to express my anger to an imaginary person in a chair....because i couldn't do it in person. Now that does make you feel like a twat!)x""",,Confused

Agape love is unconditional & not dependant on what we do. Basic training as a therapist includes acceptance, unconditional positive regard (your agape love!) & congruence (no therapist bullshit & being true to oneself). This therapist way of being can hopefully be 'contagious'. We get sorta infected with it as clients! As clients we do not need to be 'good' for our therapists within safe boundaries of course. What we need is a 'good enough' therapist also just as we needed as kids a 'good enough' mother.

It all feels very muddled...... thinking back about when i got angry as a kid, different things happened, so there was no consistent reaction to it.

I know when i got angry it always blew up very quickly and then went, so i kinda think there's no point expressing it cos i'll do/say something i'll immediately regret. Even if it's just saying to someone that they're stupid or why have they done such a thing. Which i wouldn't do anyway...... I don't really get angry, i don't think..... it's more annoyed i think.

Anger comes out for so many reasons. I might get angry that someone has taken an ingredient from the cupboard that I needed for a recipe....or angry that the NHS have put the wrong thing in my notes....or angry that my heart doesn\'t work. Each of them is different and therefore so will the reaction be.It also depends on the person who reacts and their mood on that day.There\'s no consistency behind strong ""shows"" of emotion. Too many factors involved. If you\'re trying to work anger out like this you\'re obviously not ""reacting"" instinctively at all. Do you get an angry feeling as a reaction to something? And when you get it, what do you do if it\'s strong and can\'t be rationalised? Bury it? Worry? Try to ignore it? Self harm? Tell yourself it\'s not nice to react?I wish I could suppress my anger.....I seethe if I haven\'t got an outlet for it.

Or if i knew we'd get hit, but then that would be it, again, consistent. Not particularly healthy, but consistent. But it wasn't really.... i don't think. So i think i've probably not learned ANY way to deal with anger, let alone a healthy one. I don't know how to. Maybe i'm weird.... cos i can imagine being annoyed at each of those things, and going 'grrrrrrr' at them..... but i can't imagine shouting at someone for taking something from the cupboard, crying cos the NHS had put the wrong thing in the notes, or whatever..... i mean i can't imagine reacting differently to those different scenarios. I don't know.... it doesn't make much sense to me.In answer to the first question, yes. But to the rest, it's never that strong and can't be rationalised. As I said earlier, often i find that working, or gardening - just doing something distracting - is enough to get rid of it. Often i don't see the point getting angry, cos it doesn't change anything.

I don't think there necessarily has to be 'an event' or a 'messed up childhood' behind someone's mental health issues..... though reading some of the awful stuff people on here have gone through i do sometimes feel like a fraud....... but anyway... sometimes just the person we are, in the situation we're in, is enough to send us silly, but wouldn't affect a different person in the same situation.I don't think i'm a problem personality. I think...... what do i think..... i think that.......stuff happened when i was a kid which made me very sadand lonelyand scared, it wasn't traumatic or abusivebut it hurtfor some reasonand now i know what it was, and why it affected me (sort of) and that it's ok to be affected by it...... and hopefully it won't any more.""",NicoretteGummed,Pensive

Fortunately (!) i only saw for 8 sessions, i think it was. Then she referred me on to the current one.Agree again. She's asked me several times if i'm ok to go at the end of a session. And has said she's not going to let me 'crash' after we finish. Not sure how that's going to happen, but anyway. And again.... agree!! Had this said to me lots of times.I think i've been incredibly lucky re therapist. She did say once that they do try and match the clients with the therapists, presumably because they know relationship is a huge part of the therapy.

204,2013-04-03 16:12:00,Callalily,"b""Therapy is terrifying, to lay yourself out to someone like that, probably in a way that you have never even done with yourself. I feel like therapy unpicks you at the sides, everything starts falling out the sides, I often sit and talk to people (other than my therapist) and wonder how they can't see that I am literally falling apart in front of their very eyes. I think you know you are quieter than usual though, you are shutting down because it frightens you that it is ending, you are trying to adjust to the fact you will not have that safe place for much longer I often wonder why my sister has never been effected the way I have, I believe it is down to our genetic makeup, some people are better at sports, some are not as creative as others. It is not a weakness that someone is not an Olympic athlete though, it can do a lot of harm comparing ourselves with others imo. Who is to say that your brother has dealt with things in the right way? Maybe he has just not dealt with things at all? Is that better? I'm not sure.You are most certainly not a fraud  although I think this is a common feeling amongst a lot of us, it comes down to the dangers of comparing again. I think it is not about the experiences, not what we have gone through it is about our feelings and emotions relating to these things. If I lost my phone, I would feel totally lost, like I had lost a limb, exposed that someone may read personal things, that they may ring up a huge bill, send abusive messsages. Yet my friend lost her phone a while back, she said she found it invigorating, she loved that she didn't depend on it, that she wasn't always contactable. We all deal with the same situations in different ways.Therapy working is very dependent on the relationship with the therapist. I personally am at a stage where I find it horrific, I think it is making me worse. You have comforted me a lot on this and told me that it does help, that I will benefit and be a better person for it and I am so grateful to you. Look back through the posts and see what you have written in response to others, you have all the answers, you just need to apply them to yourself """,pepecat,None
205,2013-04-03 21:48:00,pepecat,"b'I think that\'s probably right, and she\'s said as much. I suppose part of me doesn\'t see the point in saying how i feel about it, cos it\'s not going to change anything. It\'s ending, and that\'s that. How i feel about it is almost irrelevent. But part of me wants to say it, and say it and get it all out. You know, that\'s a very good point. I should know this..... she\'s said to me before that comparing with others is not helpful, cos if it\'s an issue for you, then it\'s an issue. Doesn\'t matter how big or small or whatever. Thank you. I think you\'re right - therapy is very dependent on the relationship with the therapist and how that works. I found it SO hard at the start..... and i\'ve said several times to my therapist that i\'m sorry i was such a pain in the arse at the start. She tells me i wasn\'t, and says that for the first year i just needed someone to sit with who would let me be me, which makes sense. It took that long for me to trust her enough to be able to be me and then start looking at the crap bits of me. Do you feel like you can work with your therapist? If so, i\'d say stick with it and see what happens, i think..... therapy can often make us feel worse before we feel better, so sometimes it does feel like a pointless waste of time, or that you\'re \'clashing heads\' with the therapist.... but, in my experience, it gets better. I""m not you, and i don\'t know your situation obviosuly, but if you think it can work, i think i\'d say stick with it. If it\'s making it worse though, then...... i dunno, though...... it\'s your call i guess. I\'m waffling.....'",Callalily,Pensive
206,2013-04-03 22:24:00,Callalily,"b""I think I can work with him yes, I find him very good. I have never had anyone who has listened and validated me before, I guess I am not used to that. If I say I am angry about X but I shouldn't be because of Y, he will say you have every right to be angry and then goes into the details of why I should be. It's very interesting but the feelings are so raw. I didn't have it today like I should have and have been a bit of a mess because of it to be honest  I have spoken at length about therapy during therapy, he says that I struggle so much between sessions because I have never felt able to say how I feel, I am always worrying about how what I say will make the other person feel. My CPN said I should write down thoughts, I told him I am struggling to, I just can't get it out quick enough or even at all. He says it is because I am not at a point where I can verbalise a lot of my pain yet. I can't see how I will ever be ok with it ending, I am so scared I am going to see him as the parent I never had, how can I then give that up? I don't feel that now but I know someone who is in a right state because of therapy and I think that makes me more scared. He listens and understands, he doesn't invalidate everything I think and feel. It is as if I have turned the tap on and I can't fully turn it off between sessions, even writing this now I am starting to get knots in my stomach again. I expect everyone to let me down in some way, because everyone has (that is not to say that I haven't let others down) but I can't rely on anyone but myself. Now I am starting to put trust in someone else and it literally terrifies me that I am going to do this to just be hurt all over again.

207,2013-04-04 11:01:00,pepecat,"b""He sounds good. It is a bit weird to get used to the fact the we might be allowed to feel how we do.... I found that (and still find it) really hard. It's the one thing i still really struggle with. The voice in my head is still going 'shouldn't feel like that / shouldn't think that'. Not having therapy becuase of a break or whatever, is hard. I didn't have it on tues, and don't have it next week either...... And then we only have six left. It's hard dealing with emotions outside of the 50 mins ('the therapeutic hour').. I don't always do it very well. I find writing helps. I found that too actually...... i don't worry too much about how what i say will make the other person feel - i figure my therapist sits there and listens to (most probably) far worse stuff then i say to her - she said once that she's heard methods of s/h that most people probably would never imagine - so i don't get too worried about that. She did also say to me - about a year ago i think - that i didn't yet have a 'language' for expressing how i felt. I don't mean in the sense of speaking english or whatever, but more that i couldn't say 'i feel.....' or if i could, all i could say what 'i feel bad' and not get any more specific than that. It took a while before i was able to start saying 'i feel sad' or whatever. You'll get there...... it might take a while, but you'll get there. Took me about a year..... Yeah, that's the hard bit...... i kinda see my therapist as a parent (and she knows this, i told her), and in a way, that's kinda right. I suppose it's the whole transference thing - in a way we're supposed to see them like that, and transfer our feelings from when we were a kid on to the therapist, in a safe place, so that they can be mended. If he's a good therapist (and it sounds like he is), he'll work the ending out properly with you, and not let you go before you're ready. I'm already over their 'time limit' of two years, but she said it was her decision and i wasn't ready to go earlier (at the two year point), so she's kept me a bit longer. I know i go on about how awful the ending is, and it is, but if you've done enough good stuff and enough mending with him, and worked through ending properly, i think ultimately it'll be ok. It's ok - i don't mind you writing on here. It's relevent anyway, so it's fine! I think that's the killer for me - that it's ulitmately down to me to look after myself..... and i hate that. I don't give enough of a shit about myself to do that for myself. And that scares me for the end of therapy. I worry that it'll just go back to being shitty again. I can't parent myself at the moment..... And with ending therapy, what makes it doubly bad is that the person that you trust and listens to you, and validates you, also hurts you in a way by ending therapy, but you need them with you to help you through the ending. So you need the person, but they're hurting you, all at the same time. But, as she keeps saying, if good stuff hadn't been done in therapy, and if the relationship hadn't meant anything, then it wouldn't hurt. We're sad because the relationship has been good, and meaningful, but the thing is to remember the good stuff. Gees, i really should take my own advice.........""",Callalily,Pensive

There I talk to myself-start with how I feel, what is my body saying to me, think about what I have to do, what would be good to do. Have done this since starting my 1st counselling course in 1988. There I can have a sensible conversation or a crazy conversation, practice being my own best friend or my best fiend if I want & when I've got a lot on my plate-clear what I need to.For me it's also a way to wake-up to a fully-felt now or 'go into' my head & shut-off if I choose. Put the bricks back in my wall (Pink Floyd/Alice Miller) if that is my choice at that moment & be somewhere else. I wonder whether choice & power are issues? As a donkey (?)

In my practice I celebrate endings usual through a food & drink (alcohol-free) & maybe a gift-there is shared sadness & joy sometimes.Besides writing to myself I find meditation & mindfulness techniques great to be aware of how I feel with the awareness that they will change-we can't bottle joy & have a swig when we need to & neither can we hang on to sadness unless we choose to hang on to it until we're ready to let go, perhaps.My story is one of using my head to survive & then waking up to feeling without going under or crazy as I once did.

For me the first is agape love that is not dependant on what my client does or does not do-that would be \'conditional\' love that most kids got. However you are your therapist will still accept & love you. Congruence in my translation is no bullshit so hopefully your therapist will continue to be open & honest with you.As others have said there is no \'right\' way to grieve, only your way, & that is the right way.You mentioned your cat coming for a cuddle. I think animals & human beings (!) can be incredibly intuitive & know what we need better than we do. I\'m thinking when I was drowning in my doctoral thesis (madness & spiritual emergence/y) dog & cat joined me on the garden swing seat in my despair. That was usual for Rocky the collie, but most unusual for Candy cat. Then when I felt mauled almost violated (!) at my viva voce for my doctorate I wanted to crawl under a rock & die.

I really get how important this woman has been to you too, and I know that you are anticipating this loss with great trepidation....but, and this is clearly incredibly obvious,....it is going to end.This is poignant for me this morning because I\'ve been sat with my son outpouring his feelings about the end of his relationship (that happened last night) with his girlfriend. He has his first A\'level exam on Friday, he\'s already messed up a practical exam last week due to this situation, and ..... let\'s face it.....he can only allow this girl (3 month relationship) to impact so much on his future. (This is practical Mum talking!) But he can\'t let go right now and says that it will take him weeks to get over it and he can\'t face revision....he got drunk last night! Hmmmm....Now, I am not directly comparing your situation to this one, which obviously has an element of teenage angst and over-reaction to it. But it is similar in that he, currently, can only focus on the loss of this girl and cannot see the bigger picture.The bigger picture for him is his exams and his future and possibly learning valuable lessons from this relationship. I also pointed out to him (prematurely probably) that there are ways of thinking/adjusting to the situation which lessen the pain. For example, ""re-evaluate your response after the exams"", ""remember the good times"" and ""consider this a positive, learning experience"".Yes there is hurt, yes there is pain but those emotions....although overwhelming....are not the ""whole picture."" There has been a great deal of benefit derived from your relationship with this therapist Pepecat, (not sure about my son!) and this was always going to be a process. Processes lead to change and change is what you need because you have felt unhappy for too long. Try to move this onwards by looking for a contingency plan....a way of dealing with this that leads to progression rather than focussing on loss and the past. Those feelings of loss are important and it is actually good that you feel them, but recovery and moving forward matters too.I moved on from therapy by attending a ""confidence building course"" for another 6 weeks and by trying to ""air"" and deal with some of my issues that I took to therapy. Not all of this has been successful and it\'s a work in progress, but it has given me a new focus and something to take forward.Could you find something too....? You can\'t just stop therapy and have nowhere safe to go to express your feelings again. Think real life alternatives and actively seek them out.

280,2013-06-05 10:00:00,MissKitty,"b'Hey Pepecat,As you may know I\'ve recently asked for my notes and as a result I\'ve read various letters about me. I disagree with about 20% of the information within them and I thought I was crystal clear in meetings.My point is that you need to build in factors like a) how many clients she has in a day b) how good her notes are following meetings c) don\'t take this the wrong way, but the relative importance of how you feel about what you say to her, compared how important she feels it is d) the need to condense facts into a written form for a professional letter.I think it\'s a good idea to look at the letter again in a few days and to pull out any statements that are inaccurate. These need to be challenged as they form part of your medical history. The rest of it you need to reflect on, as your reaction is probably an emotional one, and this is a professional letter. Letters written by psychologists reflect their professional opinion. Emotions and feelings are kept out of it, even if they emerged in therapy as empathy and a connection. Reading such a ""cold"" analysis of the situation is hard for this reason. I\'ve read letters about me and hit the roof! My husband has read them and simply scanned them for facts and been unable to understand my fury.Think about how she would come over as a professional to your GP if she communicated with the warmth and empathy used in therapy. Less detached, less analytical, less professional perhaps? She cannot afford to come over in that way. You know that. As for a 6 month consolidation period, I think that may be helpful. In any relationship a 6 month break can be good because feelings settle during that time into the important issues and the ones which are an initial knee jerk reaction to being ""abandoned"" or alone again. You will be back to depending on your own resources again, and you can begin to think about how and if you have changed. 2 years of therapy is a long time. Questions need to be asked about it\'s effect and whether it has been meaningful and helpful for you. If it has been, how has this affected your life and where are the gaps that still need to be looked into if you go back into therapy? Only time will tell. 6 months is a reasonable amount of time to reflect on these things.If I was you I would put the letter away for a few days and then read it , with your analytical head on. Deal with those inaccuracies and then try to get on with life. If you are able to reflect on where you need more help and equally importantly, where differences are beginning to be made as a result of therapy, you will be in a better place to re-access what you need later on and make your case convincingly.I hope that makes sense to you.x'",,Confused

They\'re an unpredictable bunch as far as I\'m concerned, but yours may be different. Don\'t know.Personally, I think I would focus on the things that were not dealt with in therapy in your meeting with him. If your therapist acknowledged that they were outstanding and needed to be talked about, that\'s back up for what you are saying and asking for. That would seem to be a fairly safe bet.I think that you could also explain how hard it was for you in the beginning and how 2 years of therapy didn\'t amount to 2 years as it took you a while to open up and gain benefit from the relationship.He may focus on any attachments formed between yourself and the therapist and want to examine how that is affecting your need to reconnect with her...... that may require a bit of thought between then and now as it\'s difficult to hide true feelings and psych\'s are pretty perceptive on the whole I found!Maybe you also need to project yourself forward in time?So, what if you get this extra time with your therapist? How long do you want? If it is short term, will you spend the sessions worrying about the ending again? If not, how will you handle it differently this time to ensure that you achieve some closure and acceptance?The trouble with a therapeutic relationship is that it will end. That\'s the bit that is hard for you perhaps.You don\'t want those boundaries perhaps? And if not, why not? Very difficult questions to ask yourself, but perhaps necessary ones if you are to be granted extra therapy and make the best use of it.I hope that doesn\'t sound too tough.

So here\'s mine""Transference & Counter-TransferenceTerms originally used in psychoanalysis to describe the response of client totherapist and vice versa. What the client brings can be called proactivetransference, what the therapist brings proactive counter-transference, thetherapists reaction reactive counter-transference, and what the client reactsto in response to what the therapist brings counter-transference or reactivecounter-transference (after Clarkson, 1995). These may prove destructive orfacilitative (ibid).""These are ideas that are not real in one sense, in the sense that this Mac keyboard on which I am pecking with one finger is real (to me). It is not healthy to treat ideas as if they are tangible-I can see, touch & smell shit in my wheel-barrow; if it were transference there how real would that be?With transference we put someone else\'s face on the bod in front of us. As a student nurse I met loads of nursing sisters who were just like me critical mother I was in semi-pemanent rebellion mode & never became a state-registered nurse-thank God.For me, a healthier approach to life, the world & the universe is to accept that the only reality for me & you is NOW-what we experience in the moment. We can alter our personal \'now\' by bringing our history in, or bringing imagined future into \'now\'. I think this to a degree is healthy-if I eat an \'Easy-Cook\' meal with Demerara sugar in the sauce, as a diabetic, it will screw-up my blood-sugar later.I\'ll bring in another idea""Field theoryAccording to Lewin (1997) the field is the \xc2\x91life-space\xc2\x92 of the individual. Thereare three qualities of life space:1. Existence, in that all those facts that have existence must be treated as asingle interdependent field i.e. a single coherent system of constructs. Aconstruct is what may be defined after a conceptual analysis of the elementsof construction of a phenomenon. A phenomenon may be described as anobject of our subjective experience of reality awareness (Mackewn, 1997).2. Interdependence to some degree.3. Contemporaneity, in that, although life-space endures through time andthus is a product of personal history and modified by events, only thecontemporaneous system can have any effects at any time. In other wordsonly \xc2\x91now\xc2\x92 reality can change the field.""These definitions come from the Glossary of my thesis & I\'m thinking flippin \'eck what the hell does that mean. It means that we have the power to change our \'now\' reality by what we do, see, feel, think & hear NOW. We can think transference/counter-transference & projection is happening all the time. Projection is what we imagine but don\'t know. The antidote is don\'t project-ask or find out! . Personal example is when we got back from Toulouse (sanctuary hunting-on telly next year!) I had to pick up a recorded delivery letter from the Post Office. I imagined (projected) that he had not picked up the RD I sent asking him to sign a form for my re-accreditation & I was up shit-creek without a paddle.

We are not stupid we are affected by others-objects, people, animals all the time & that's healthier sometimes than to lose our awareness through pills, too much alcohol (or a low blood sugar-that's maybe just me!). Those of us who have had less than 'good-enough' mothering build a brick-wall to protect ourselves. (Check out Alice Miller-The Drama of the Gifted Child & Pink Floyd-The Wall). We feel safe but very lonely within our castle. When we remove some bricks when it is safe with another we are open to contact/feeling with them. When they are gone-not through our choosing-that hurts like hell & we can externalise that pain in ways that give some relief.For me I use logic/cognition/thinking to put the bricks back in my wall. However, with your therapist you were able to open up I think & you can continue to do that when safe for you with stuff that is nourishing. Choose things/people that are beautiful for you. I have a wonder-full metal singing bowl whose sound I love-I feel good when we 'sing' together. I also chose a beautiful 7-string, yew-wood sounding bowl that is beautiful to see, hold & play. If you Google Tobias Kaye you'll find them. All this stuff about transference, acceptance, unconditional positive regard & congruence, in my view, can be named as love. When we're not used to it, it is hard to accept, & when we lose love perhaps before time it hurts like hell & leaves a hole we think can never be filled. However, as you were loved you can begin the process of being open to love/contact with life & all that holds.My dog is 'talking' to me-time for a run, poo & pee & bed-that's mostly the dog!Go well,Roger""",,None

The 'system' meant you had to end & that was not your choice.In my private practice as a psychotherapist an ending of therapy is a mutual choice. And because previous endings may have been shit we explore how this ending can be a celebration of all that is different and positive, without denying the sadness of the ending. This typically involves chocolate gateau, Sainsbury's alcohol-free fizz & an appropriate gift as a memento or 'touch-stone' for memories of our relationship.So to repeat, the ending was not your choice so perhaps you are left in limbo-not a good place as I know from personal experience-I 'accidentally' set up a blog on Sunday, and decided to write of my experience then. I said I felt in 'Limbo' - that was unpleasant, uncertain & lots of doubt, not knowing & not understanding-not a good place to be. This all perhaps relatively trivial by comparison Pepecat, so forgive me. Our house is for sale & as soon as we sell we are 'emigrating' to France to buy our personal & eventually professional Sanctuary-a key factor in the Recovery Model from my doctoral thesis. However, we are in Limbo-lots of viewing but no acceptable offer yet. I thought what is this 'limbo' what I'm in? I discovered from 'Wiki' that it's a sorta Catholic purgatory with a 'orrible' picture by H. Bosch of Christ in Limbo. That cheered me up a bit 'cos my limbo is nowhere near that, thank God.Anyway, I'm thinking of you Pepecat & hope your appointment goes well & are soon in a much more pleasant place.All the best,Roger""",pepecat,None

They were very helpful & played the notes of several singing bowls after ringing me. Apparently we all have a particular sound that resonates for us. When I left therapy years ago I gave my therapist one as a gift because he meditates daily. My own experience is that meditation is calming and raises my self-other awareness and is good for me. Personally I may light a candle, belly-breathe & focus on the flame; I find this calming. I may also, when I've got a lot on my plate or feel confused write or draw in my journal if there is imagery when I close my eyes. Just to walk with your friend or partner may be helpful-not to open up about anything but just walk & talk.I believe whole-heartedly in the idea of social synapses. Connections that we make with god (if we have one), people, music, animals & even objects that we love change us & them. My therapy room at home is a sanctuary for people who come to see and for me-it is full of stuff that I love & has meaning-there is a stillness there & I think to create our own sanctuary inside out can be excellent if we can make the space.For Miss Kitty, when we create our French sanctuary: stone, maybe a barn, breathing space & space to walk, swimming pool & jacuzzi (cash-permitting!!!) there will be the opportunity for mindfulness, group work, therapy, art, joga all accompanied by fine food & wine (French chef to do that). There will be yurts or posh tents for accommodation for 5-day workshops called 'Growing Old Dis-Gracefully'. Family will do the yoga & artwork by the way.

If you want to play here is a link where you can see & hear the bowlsLarge Singing bowls : Singing Bowls at Bodhisattva Trading Co.I also have a meditation sounding bowl, chosen for its appearance & I love its sound, here it is on YouTube (I met Tobias when he ran a workshop at a conference-music therapists use them when working with very disturbed kids) Comparing Heart and Meditation styles of Sounding Bowl - YouTubeFor me it\'s one of those nourishing healthy \'social synapses\' similar but slightly different to synapse/connection with therapists & others.On occasions I\'ve had a \'god-experience\', aka a \'baptism of the Holy Spirit\' & \'know\' my god in a way. Don\'t let Christians put you off Christ & if you want to meet one who will-look in the mirror(!) was good advice I was given.Here\'s a bit from my thesis that is relevant-""Other chosen anomalous experiences include those involving meditation andother rituals. Krippner (2005, p.66) says meditators and nuns may have \'God- experiences\' through a neurological process referred to as \'kindling\'. Krippner(ibid, p. 66) quotes research by Persinger (1987a) that suggests\xc2\x91their experiences were brought about not only by epileptic-type tendencies,but by drugs, unusual diets, grief, fatigue, sensory deprivation, sensory overstimulation (e.g. piercing music) and various personal dilemmas and stressorsall of which seem to be associated with temporal lobe lability\xc2\x92.This links to the \xc2\x91stress-model\xc2\x92 discussed earlier (pp.47-48). Beauregard &O\xc2\x92Leary (2007) conducted neuroscientific research on the RSMEs (Religious,Spiritual or Mystical Experience) of Carmelite nuns. They found (p. 274) nun\xc2\x92sRSME\xc2\x92s increased theta activity in the brain, in which\xc2\x91\xc2\x92.""B & R did brainscans on nuns who were using their Rosary beads & could see the changes that they \'kindled\'.A bit beyond Richard Dawkins\' ken I think. At the time I had mine in a \'happy-clappy\' church I likened it to when I was on the Popside watching The Rams play Chelsea-we all got behind them chanting \'Derby! clap-clap-clap\' over & over again. It was as if the whole crowd were one, willing Derby to score. And when we did & beat them-ecstasy!!! Sorry you had to be there really & probably Dawkins wouldn\'t \'get\' that either or reduce it to chemical changes-poor sod!Pepecat, I think sanctuary is a place inside us as well where we can be still & calm although perhaps that needs to be \'kindled\' as well.Maybe positive transference or healthy connections with people & things real or imagined (not by Dawkins with his philosophical limitations) is/are extremely good for us.Now for Bargain Hunt-one antique looking at other antiques.With Love.'",,None

How many therapists are in full awareness of their own shadow? & have integrated & accepted those & all parts of themselves?Even with the greats & founders of psychology there are big question marks over them - even with those that were highly aware of & discussed at depth more transpersonal/spiritual matters, such as Jung & Assagioli. i suppose it depends what someone is really seeking?

Difficulty in making eye contact maybe due to 'shame' being triggered. If you Google the affect (feeling) theory of Sylvan Tomkins or check out Gershen Kaufman's 'Psychology of Shame' they may be interesting. Titles & names are from memory so may be wrong but close so good enough. Tomkins observed babies & toddlers & their mothers in order to form his ideas about separation & connection & feelings.It can be interesting to think who you most disliked in the past & how were they? Sometimes those qualities may be you on a bad day, perhaps your 'shadow', that is seen more easily in others, of course! You may then 'project' your shadow in the form perhaps of feelings onto the other. A working but arguable idea is that we 'transfer' people & project our shadow-feelings.These are concepts & theories & may not 'fit' for you at all. To 'reify' theory is to treat it as concrete or solid like the keyboard I'm pecking at! This is bad news 'cos they are 'only' theories so kick 'em into touch if they don't help & use 'em if they do.Oh, and Derby were absolute crap last night-god it was awful!!!

Well..... having grown up in a 'happy clappy' church and had similar experiences there AND also been to watch the Arsenal play several times, and been part of the football crowd... it's interesting how similar the experiences are. I thought about this a lot at the time - it's a sort of collective external experience at a football match - the team are on the pitch in front of you, so you're all encouraging them (and shouting at the ref), and there's a kind of peer pressure to join in to prove you are really a fan, in spite of the fact that you're at the match and watching. It's VERY easy to get caught up in that and go with it, and i can completely see how crowd mentality works; safety in numbers against a common 'enemy'. Very weird.... but exhilerating at the same time. Church is more of a collective inner experience i think..... but (in me) it generates the same sort of feelings as i had at the football.

We affirm the love of God for all people, whatever their sexuality'.Which is rather nice.

She spent her entire childhood between church and home, and felt unable to continue when she married outside the catholic church and my father refused to have us (her children) brought up as catholics. Disclosures by the church since regarding children sold abroad, orphanages and abuse have caused her to question the people she trusted. Understandable....but difficult for her to digest, because she has always lived by those values.In terms of being disapproved of, for your sexuality, that must be very difficult to digest too. You can\'t be truthful and upfront about your relationship for fear of judgement. That doesn\'t sound terribly Christian to me nor in touch with the 21st century......but then churches are notorious for the latter. Perhaps change is needed, and you could be part of that change? I wonder how gay priests and female clergy manage in the face of such strong opposition and adverse feelings from their peers / congregation and management? It\'s been a long fight for the women hasn\'t it....but they\'ve done it. Presumably, they have stood strong and true to their own values whilst waiting for the church to catch up. It takes a very strong faith to do that I imagine and patience. Quite isolating at times I imagine, but that suggests to me that these people - the women - would be worth talking to for inspiration.There must be female clergy / gay clergy out there ..... the female ones being easier to track down I suspect.

The theory is that our body carries a memory of everything that has ever happened to us-thank God we forget most of it! Those memory \'triggers\' are in us or outside us-music, face, touch, smell-anything really so we are \'tipped\' back into that experience & feel it again.Just as many of those memories are bad so we can substitute good ones by imagining good things. So ""Imagine that we are lying on the warm golden sand of a tropical paradise, every muscle is supported, feel the warmth from the beach & how good it is to relax"" & so on like a typical relaxation cd. The difference is when we are relaxed we use the physical or verbal triggers to train our instinctive/autonomous/automatic/animal nervous system to relax \'on command\' in a way. So after practicing at home in peace, when we are out in the wild world we just belly-breathe & relax with our chosen physical or verbal \'trigger\'-can even be perfume or after-shave.The other good technique is to use a personal loving journal for your self/selves so you get those worrying thoughts out of you & down on paper. You make them external as a way of being your own best friend or your own therapist.PS I can reference all this stuff if you wish & just because I can reference it, it doesn\'t make it \'right\' for you!!!

The fact is that, apart from a recent study into CBT, that showed some evidenced based effectiveness, there is no other categorical studies/evidence of any kind of the effectiveness of any psychological/therapeutic approach - That is a very poor show on the part of this field. i'm not saying that certain approaches can't be potentially effective, but if we're looking for evidence/proof to pin something down, it's incredibly little that can be. i've tried 7 therapists (short term), & not found any of them very helpful, certainly none of it resolved anything, & a few of them made things worse. The most help has been my own efforts, family, friends, & alternative healers, one in-particular. The healer i work with now isn't trained in any formal psychological/therapeutic approach, but what has helped is that he is very accepting/non-judgemental/patient, allows me to discuss what i want to discuss, & listens - there isn't as much of a projection/transference, there is an allowance to work out my own understanding/perspectives/conclusions. There is far too much projection/prescriptive behaviour that goes on with therapists imo. & the entire field of psychology, even including the founders such as Freud, Jung, Adler, Assagioli, etc - is very far from a 'done deal' - The field is limited, it doesn't fully explain/understand the psyche/human condition. Very hard to find therapists who are aware & wise enough in their own development, as well as being in a position to be of actual help for what the client needs to work through & actually resolve their issues. i suppose it's all individual again, but i hear very little of people being cured from therapy? (Other than Jung i don't really see what great improvement to humanity there has been?) - i'd think that most people are better to become their own therapists - or seek out the genuinely self-realised.

If you check out the so-called \'gold standard\' of research-Random Control Trials-so many people have CBT, some have Treatment As Usual and others have \'Supportive Counselling\' you will find huge flaws in the research design. There is the \'equivalent environment assumption\'. The researchers assume that participants share the same \'life-space\' if you like and the only difference is CBT, TAU or SC. Your \'life-space\' is very different to mine & everyone else\'s-how on earth can it be \'equivalent\' I wonder.This thread concerns Pepecat\'s \'transference\' in her therapy and its ending and her questions about that, I think. What I am writing, in a way, goes beyond the Freudian notion of transference in a positive way, I hope.Having had a diagnosis of \'acute schizophrenia in my 20\'s, on doing a psychopathology workshop \'Mental Illness: Mystery or Mis-Story?\', I was aware that no-one prior to treatment with ECT & Largactyl heard my \'story\' in any real sense for me. This prompted \'what ifs\' about perspectives on psychopathology & 8 years research with mental health professional who are now OK.Here are some points and counter-points re \'outcomes\' from that research:""Since Implications for Practice (p.200) is part of the research question I willbriefly consider outcome research and positive change. Wampold (2001, p.xii) from his review of the research says\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\xa6the scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports a model of psychotherapythat gives primacy to the healing context, to the understanding of one\xe2\x80\x99sdifficulties, to the faith in the therapy, and to respect for the client\xe2\x80\x99sworldview\xe2\x80\x99.He concludes allegiance to, and the type of therapy are not relevant and\xe2\x80\x98It is now clear that the particular therapist delivering the treatment isabsolutely crucial, adding support for the contextual model of psychotherapy\xe2\x80\x99.His context is that he wishes to challenge the American medical model ofpsychotherapy where medical insurance is only available for specificpsychotherapies for specific conditions. From their review of outcome studies,Evans and Gilbert (2005, p.36) suggest most benefit from psychotherapy, butno one approach is more beneficial:\xe2\x80\x98we can reach a dodo-bird verdict-it is usually true that everybody has wonand all must have prizes!\xe2\x80\x99 (Luborski et al, 1975).Their alignment is with the following positions (ibid, p.43)\xe2\x80\x98honouring the client\xe2\x80\x99s view of the change process; honouring the co-creationof the therapeutic relationship as the vehicle and context for change; andbeing sensitive to the contextual demands of the situation in which therapytakes place\xe2\x80\x99.The authors (ibid, p. 159) also say those who rely on NHSmental health services do not have access to the choice of modalitiesavailable to those who can pay,\xe2\x80\x98Whether the defence of the status quo is based on dogma or so-calledevidence based research, or officially denied, the vast majority of modalitiesare being excluded.\xe2\x80\x99As a counterpoint to these positive views of psychotherapy Masson (1990, p.30) argues for its abolition claiming it is fraudulent, corrupt and abusive andsuggests self-help groups and\xe2\x80\x98What we need are more kindly friends and fewer professionals.\xe2\x80\x99I can give you the rest of the references in full if you want? However, I wholeheartedly agree with the quote from Masson (Masson, J. M. (1990). Against Therapy. London: Fontana Paperback)Callalily you asked about suggestions and moving on. My \'prescription\' would be agape (unconditional) love. I advocate the process of \'selfing\' = look after your \'self\' with a \'fierce and tender regard\' in every which way. Personally I love that Cozolino says we are biological beings in a social world and use thinking, feeling, action and imagination to\xe2\x80\x98find comfort and clarity through spiritual beliefs. Thus, we are constructedof a fabric of all these processes, and they all affect our experience and wellbeing.Therefore, we should not limit ourselves to a narrow set of clinicaltools in our therapeutic work.Everything from intimate relationships to medication to church attendance tohaving an affectionate pet has been shown to have a positive impact onphysical and mental health.

It helped me massively, and had a deep effect on me. Because of that, i miss it hugely. Does that mean it was bad, or not worth it? I don't think so. It's a like a bereavement, in a way. Except with a real bereavement, the person is gone and you know you'll never see them again - that door is closed. With therapy, the person is still there, still working at the place, still alive and on the planet, so the door is still there and still open, only you're not allowed to go there again. There are some things i wish i'd talked about, and i didn't, and i do wish we'd had a bit more time - when you have a good therapy relationship, why on earth would you want it to end?! - but overall, it was a positive experience.

583,2014-02-12 10:58:00,pepecat,"b'I think that\'s because the studies into other forms of therapy other than CBT just haven\'t been done. There are a lot of studies into the effectiveness of CBT, but hardly anything into other forms, such as psychodynamic, and people are realising this and more studies are beginning to be done. My workplace subscribes to The Psychologist journal (the british psychological society journal) and this months edition had a big feature all about CBT versus other therapies, and whether CBT had been too widely touted as the \'cure all\' to the detriment of other therapies. It was a very interesting feature with articles from people pro and con CBT. Personally, I""m not sure therapy is about \'cure\', or even \'resolution\'. Meds certainly don\'t cure or resolve anything - they mask and dull etc. Therapy, i think, (for me) was more about understanding. I understand now why i think / feel / react the way i do. I understand why i get anxious a lot, and i know that distraction, for me, is the thing that works the best to get rid of that. I understand now that having people want to know stuff about me scares me because of certain things / patterns from my childhood. None of those understandings cures the problem. I still get anxious, I still don\'t like people knowing stuff about me, I still don\'t open up to people much, but at least now i know WHY those tihngs are the case. And, armed with that knowledge / understanding, i can then chose how to be. I learnt in therapy that opening up to someone and having someone know personal stuff about you can be ok and i wouldn\'t be judged or laughed at - now it\'s kinda up to me whether i chose to let people in in the real world based on that good experience, or if i chose not to, and withdraw myself and be lonely and miserable again. I will probably always be susceptible to depression and anxiety, and that\'s ok. I can live with that. I can also deal with it a lot better and i understand the things that trigger it and what i need to do and how i need to live to manage it.

In that sense i'd tend now to lean more towards some form of mainstream psychiatric view/approach, despite all it's failings. Roger & a Journal of psychotherapy is going to say how wonderful it all is. But if it all was so wonderful then why do so many people suffer the way they do? Why has 100 years of psychotherapy not really changed anything? What really has the field contributed overall to humanity & in the overall treatment of the those that suffer with mental illness? If psychotherapy hasn't made a convincing case in a hundred years, then why hasn't it? & is it ever really going to?i've been blamed for 'blocking' therapeutic help, even though a therapists main job is to identify & help people work through blocks - if the therapy doesn't work then blame the client, & that really is the attitude. My own short foray into psychotherapy left me feeling blamed, invalidated, not listened to, resentful, & very much changed my views on it all.

The hard realities are also for the vast majority of people is that they don't have access to appropriate & in depth psychological (& social) help/support. & that isn't their fault. i can't & haven't been able to find a decent therapist, & then pay them for as much individual tailored support that i feel i need - none of them will even listen to what i want to discuss to begin with, all they do is project whatever model they have studied. i've had very little psychological/social support from services - & that isn't my fault either, as people love to blame.

This prompted 'what ifs' about perspectives on psychopathology & 8 years research with mental health professional who are now OK.[Moderated]Yet again we have the same story - born also from the more official statistics, that a third of people generally have one episode of brief reactive psychosis & go on to not have any reoccurring problems/difficulties with it all. i don't think that is comparable to those that either remain very ill their whole lives, or those who go through multiple/major breakdowns. i don't think that the differences can either be blamed on individuals. Personally i feel some peoples conditions/illness is a lot worse than others, regardless of the labels. & the worse it all is, the less help you get - the milder, the more help & support you'll get. What do 'you' do if no one will genuinely listen to/acknowledge/validate/understand 'your' story?The authors (ibid, p. 159) also say those who rely on NHSmental health services do not have access to the choice of modalitiesavailable to those who can pay,A massive & very real problem, & great injustice.

Thus, we are constructedof a fabric of all these processes, and they all affect our experience and wellbeing.Therefore, we should not limit ourselves to a narrow set of clinicaltools in our therapeutic work.Everything from intimate relationships to medication to church attendance tohaving an affectionate pet has been shown to have a positive impact onphysical and mental health.

OK, it might not resolve / cure every little last thing, but in a way, i think that\'s unrealistic. And I\'m not sure that\'s the job of psychotherapy anyway. Therapy did enough to enable me to make more conscious choices about how i react to things, rather than unconscious reactions that i wasn\'t even aware were going on or why. I think it\'s probably resolved some things, others not so much, maybe there\'s other stuff that i don\'t know about that it\'s not even touched, but at least now I""m much better at thinking \'Ok, why am i getting wound up about x?\' and thinking how it connects with stuff in my past, and then deciding what to do with that information. For me, that\'s a big change. I don\'t think one can say that because no convincing case has been made, that there isn\'t one. That seems a bit simplistic. Maybe the people who have been helped by psychotherapy are out there, but no one\'s bothered to talk to them. I suppose one\'s point of view will be influenced by a sort of expectation about what sort of impact you\'d like it to have made. What impact has increased knowledge about agriculture and crops made? You could argue none, as there are still hungry people out there. I\'m sure there are benefits though. Same with psychotherapy - there are still unwell people out there, therefore it hasn\'t helped. Seems a bit.......simplistic....to me. It\'s a lot easier to measure effectiveness for something like CBT - \'one a scale of 1 - 10, how anxious do you feel when....\' etc and so on. Easier to quantify stuff like that than un-structured therapy which can go into any and every issue you want. I might photocopy the Cbt stuff from the journal i mentioned and write some of it on here - it was interesting - and went into the reasons why studies in psychotherapy hadn\'t been done in the past. The issue isn\'t available online yet - I just looked. Different things help different people I guess - I don\'t see a problem in that. What would you like to change? If understanding your experiences hasn\'t helped, or talking them through with (unhelpful) therapists obviously hasn\'t helped, I wonder what you think it would take for change or resolution - assuming that\'s what you want, of course. (i\'m not being arsy here by the way, it\'s a genuine question asked in all seriousness).I would agree with that. If i lived where my parents live, or where i went to university, i don\'t think I\'d have had the therapy I had living here. It\'s so patchy - the coverage across the country, and it seems the criteria differ a lot as to who gets referred or not. Neither is it my fault though that I live where i live and had the therapy I had. I didn\'t wave some magic wand and it happened.

Idealistically i do lean towards more in depth psychosocial approaches being of great potential help to people - But the ideals seem very far from the realities. i'm glad it has helped with all that. Playing devils advocate - aren't there lots of things that could have achieved the same things? Like mindfulness for example? All the time we hear that there is no proper basis to psychiatry - so how is this any different? You can say the same about anything.

The point is that i don't feel i have ever been understood, nor allowed to properly discuss through my experiences. i have a very good idea of what would help & always have done, Anything & everything i've done to try & find/access such understanding & support does not appear to have been fruitful. If i had millions in the bank, could pay \xc2\xa3200 an hour for a top psychologist & afford extra care, i would expect it would all be very very different story. i do have a kind of vision about what needs to be done. & i have made massive progress overall. A lot i feel to acknowledge more just how much progress i've made, & have more trust/belief in my own strength/inner wisdom, instead of thinking that the answer is 'out there' in books, therapists or other peoples words (however dazzling), the answers i feel, for me, very much are within. i feel i need a more disciplined/structured routine & practise with things i know help, like meditation, & to focus more on all that. i don't begrudge people getting all the help in the World - it's rather the culture of blame, & general attitudes towards those that find themselves in certain difficulties/circumstances, through no direct fault of their own. i was sat somewhere the other day with one of the many charity/water aid adverts on the TV, & the person i was with was seriously saying that everyone in Africa needed to stop having children & it was all their fault. i didn't get into too much about it all.

Intellectualising it by examining where your reactions come from and why they are as they are seems to be the route you feel will work. I think that you actually have the answers that you need, but need a little more time and space to explore them and deal with them. This time in therapy be a little more dictatorial in terms of what you need perhaps. Tell your therapist what the ""themes/issues"" are that you didn\'t explore thoroughly last time and then deal with them.I think hindsight following therapy is part of the process. I have things too that I didn\'t bring up, and now I can see that they were instrumental in making me the person I am. I think it\'s normal to reflect on it all and slowly realise just what went wrong and why. Therapy isn\'t a quick fix....and 2 years might sound a lot, but for some of us it\'s a work in progress perhaps?Some people\'s lives are more complicated, their understanding less immediate and their ability to talk or accept is just slower and more gradual. It\'s taken me years to work things out and I still re-think things now and have new ""revelations"" as to how things / events / drugs have affected me. Maybe I\'m too analytical...don\'t know....but I\'ve been pretty slow to catch on with most of it. I think that for you, although painful, this period of reflection has perhaps been helpful in that you\'ve identified some of the gaps. Your therapist suggested it might be.....perhaps she was right?Ask for what you think you need now,.... then see what unfolds. But try to separate your need for the closeness of that therapeutic relationship from what you need in order to deal with your issues. I know the two became intertwined, but this time separation of the two might spare you more pain longer term if you can manage it?That might not make sense, and if not I apologise. I don\'t think I really understand transference very well myself.'",,Confused

I have a big thing about people knowing things about me, and I don\'t like psychs knowing things about me. Which i\'m aware is shooting myself in the foot (big time), but i don\'t know how to change that. Transference..... for me.... was about (this is going to sound mushy and stupid), but it was about finding something i\'d been searching for my whole life, if i\'m brutally honest. I suppose it was a way of asking why my mum wasn\'t there for me when i was a kid, and what i\'d done wrong when i was a kid, without actually asking my mum those questions (because that was / is NEVER going to happen). It was about being able to just be myself (and find out who that is, i guess), and to be scared about opening up, or be a bit stroppy about things, or be sad because i didn\'t get what i needed when i was a kid, again, without having to try again and again at those things with my mum - not that i\'d want to anyway with her...... It was about working stuff through about when i was a kid, in a safe place, with a safe person, who wouldn\'t judge, or criticise, or dismiss how i felt. And the attachment that links to that was about finding that \'mother figure\' in a way, for a while. I can\'t describe (and never could) how much that meant to me, how deeply it affected me.

628,2014-02-20 16:16:00,Reach,"b""It doesn't go away. My transference was with a male therapist almost two years ago now and i still feel that pain. I did go into a brief depression after therapy ended which i stupidly ended it prematurely myself, but the pain of the loss i don't know if it'll ever go. I feel a lot of shame about opening up, although he never knew about the transference as far as i know but he knew what my dad had done to me and how shit a dad he was, and that i was struggling to move on from that. Sorry to talk about myself when you are sturggling, you just said in one of your posts that people say it'll pass and i thought that mine hasn't yet. I suppose i think of him less but whenever i'm in the town where his office was, i panic about bumping into him. I am paranoid that he is in the cafe or shop and so i scan the room. Two years on i still do this, still have a sinking feeling. I think i saw him once in the crowd and really did panic. I used to see people that looked like him everywhere. It's stupid that i feel this way because i wasn't abused by my dad, only emotionally, but yeah that pain, acid you say, that is a good description. I don't know why it happened, he was nice to me, male, right age, there, listening. Isn't transference just the craziest thing i don't really get it still even though i've read about it. I don't even know if by you having therapy to work through it has caused you more pain than you would have felt had you not had therapy, like i don't understand it, why we should have to go through it, because as the end of the day you have lost another person, lost again, another loss and another pain over another loss. I suppose you have to think of all the good things they did for you, i need to think of the good things he brought to my life. For you, knowing that there are people out there that you can trust with your feelings, but then you say about her not replying to your letter. That is painful, he didn't reply to mine and i sent about five over the two years, some just saying i'm doing well (a lie). I wonder if she decided at a later date (after she told you she would reply to your letter) that she would no longer reply to letters or maybe, maybe she read it, and you know when you read someones letter you reply in your head, smile to yourself, think about that person, put the letter down and then sometimes forget to reply, just like with emails. Maybe there is nothing bad about her having not replied, she simply forgt, and that doesn't mean she forgot you, just that she forgot to reply to the letter. Either way, i can understand how you are feeling, i wish i didn't understand but i do, i feel it too. Luckily i have a good enough mum. I cannot imagine what it must feel like not to have had that support. I bet the pain is double as in my opinion a mum is far more important than a dad.

I'm not sure if i want mine to think of me or not. I hope he thinks good of me. I think it's nice yours said he would think of you, it sort of means that it hasn't ended. I often think i'd like to be hugged by mine and that sounds so pathetic but i really saw him as the dad i never had. I know he's just a man, but i so wanted to have been his child for real. I don't have quite the same problem with women but i do a little bit. I love my mum but she wasn't as good as i'd wished she was. She has some pretty major faults as a parent. My therapist was so calm and wise, so considered, all those things i love about people. My dad doesn't even deserve the word dad, he is just a sperm donor basically. Asshole. Fucking idiot. Okay move on from him, upsetting. You know growing up i would always unknowingly slightly attach to older men. It was confusing because naturally i would always fancy older men, like dad-age men, and i would flirt with them, but i felt strange about it all. I think i probably came across as needy. Transference can have such a major effect on your relationships and also on that empty feeling inside, for me that longing for a father, father hunger i believe it is called. I'm hungry for my old therapist, envious of any young female that he knows, especially if they are beautiful and he likes them. Envious of his own children, and embarrassingly envious of his wife because after i finished seeing him, i had intrusive thoughts of having sex with him. I don't find him attractive of course, he is a really old man, but that must be some sick transference twist. Pepecat i bet you don't get that problem with your transference pain, but i wonder if you want to be her child, if you are envious of her own children.

Then did the exact opposite, oh dear!I think I prefer having a male therapist as I tend to get on better with blokes, my mum I had a terrible relationship with.

So you get to see what it should feel like, and be like, and then they're like 'right, off you go'. That is right, yes..... and i do think of those things. But knowing there is a person out there you can trust with your feelings is not good if you can't talk to that person. I suppose the idea is that the experience with the therapist should show you that opening up and trusting people with feelings is ok, and do-able, and then you go on and do that with other people. Except it doesn't work like that. Well, not for me, anyway.Yeah.... it could be any one of those things. I suppose because she said she'd respond, then i thought she would have.

I think guidance from a therapist is important though. Mine alighted on a period in my life in my late teens when a lot was going wrong for me personally. I remember disregarding what he pointed me towards and marching on with other stuff. Looking back now I realise that that was the most important bit. I never re-visited it, such was my determination to ""sort out"" the bits I felt were important.I think reflecting afterwards, when healthy, has been useful.

It\'s more a question of eloquence and the ability to persuade and present a logical argument. People don\'t ""listen"" online, (although they do pick up on tone.) They ""read"" and have the chance to react according to their own feelings. They can also go back to it and reflect - that\'s the real power in a written argument. Logic tends to win once emotions calm down because you can analyse it in the cold light of day.If she\'s launched a personal attack.....that\'s different!

And I\'m scared of what will happen after the end of march...... I\'m scared because I won\'t be \'occupied\'..... and my mind needs disrtaction, or occupation at least, otherwise it tends to go a bit nuts and turn in on itself, and I don\'t know what\'s going to happen once i submit this thesis......That\'s a lot of ""unknowns""....When the thesis is finished there will be a weight lifted from you in terms of work load at least! Can you allow yourself some relaxation time perhaps doing something active and healthy to get you past the gap it will leave? I\'m crap at relaxing. I find exercise is the best way to make me tired and ultimately relax. Would that work for you? what do people do in the evenings? Sit and watch tele? I can\'t do that...... get too restless. Always.Need something to be picking at and doing.I\'m much the same....I hate it! Think that\'s why I end up online at night, whilst the family watch hours of tv.When I \'lose\' things (connection with church, job), and when I have time (too much of it) to think, its triggered episodes of depression in the past, and I\'m scared it could happen again. I\'ve only just got more or less well again and that took 6 years. I\'m NOT going back there again.Well....it depends what or who you are worried about losing. You\'ve had a few of those losses to deal with of late - thesis / job / therapy ....but ultimately you have fought back, embraced new challenges and done OK on the whole. You will have gained strength from your experiences and learned things about how to cope. Perhaps change will not mark a move into depression this time if you can separate the changes into good ones and more difficult ones and prepare for the harder transitions.Going back to therapy was always going to feel like a step backwards because you are exposing yourself to the same loss again I guess, but maybe the loss will feel different this time? Not so intense, a more predictable set of emotions and a greater sense of how these things must inevitably end. Is acceptance of change in life something to work on in therapy rather than focussing on the amount of changes in your life and your tendency to fear change?Change can be good and is perhaps an alternative way to deal with loss? E.g. When faced with loss, change things in your life - activity levels, hobbies etc to compensate for the losses. '",,Confused

I always said it was the hardest thing I ever did. I still think that\xe2\x80\x99s true. Opening up was hard. When you\xe2\x80\x99ve been closed your whole life, it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to let people in. But I did, and in a way, I let myself in. Or at least a part of me that had long been ignored - that I probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know existed. We found a scared, lonely little kid who needed some parenting, and in a way, that\xe2\x80\x99s what happened. Now its about dealing with the residue, I think. It\xe2\x80\x99s about coping with feeling small sometimes, with feeling anxious sometimes, with feeling utterly alone sometimes. It\xe2\x80\x99s about hanging in there and knowing those feelings will pass eventually, and doing what it takes to get through it. It\xe2\x80\x99s about crying myself to sleep, or writing it down, or distracting myself, or just plain putting up with it and waiting. It\xe2\x80\x99s about figuring out what to do with the child part of me that is scared and often howls for what it can\xe2\x80\x99t have, but wants more than anything else \xe2\x80\x93 and I have no idea how to be a parent. It\xe2\x80\x99s about wondering if this is a temporary state of affairs, or if random low moods are now part of the scenery. Whatever it is though, and however long it takes to figure out, and however much I miss the person and the place that has been a large part of this, you know what, I think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be ok.'",,Pensive

I'm not on meds, not in therapy any more (as of yesterday), and I only saw them every three or four months anyway.Whatever i said it was always 'come back in three months'. There is NO point. My gp is good, and the specialist psychotherpies service have also been brilliant. It's the less-than-helpful CMHT in the middle who aren't so good. Seems to be par for the course though. They are (unfortunately) the gateway into other services (like psychotherapy) which is a pain in the ass. My therapist did say I could contact her though, if I had any queries or anything, so its not like now I've stopped seeing her that's it, no more contact ever. I'm not 'unwell' enough for NHS services, but not quite well enough to do on my own. It's that weird middle ground that there is no provision for. Can't be seen by the 'refer yourself therapy' lot either, because I've previously been too unwell for that and have a diagnosis and have had specialist therapy. So they won't touch me, apparently.

He knew more about me than any human alive and I thought he understood me. One text did come to say that he would be there if I needed him when I got home. THis I took as total rejection. Finished with therapy with him giving an excuse. I started with a different therapist a number of months ago with the view that this is his job and he is going to keep a professional distance. He cares I guess for the hour Im there and that will have to do for now. I struggle with the fact that he does not care about me as I would like him to. I also realise that this is what I missed in my childhood - a feeling that people cared about me and liked me. With this therapist I will not get caught in the same trap (I hope)',,None
