You have lost your control over me, and your girlfriend will soon see it too. She will almost certainly see what you said tonight if she wasn't already there, and no doubt she will be feeling very pleased about it. But what she doesn't realise is if you can be this cruel to me, someone you claimed you wanted to marry and have a family with you will most definitely do it to her. And she will feel every ounce of what I do now. One day someone will be smarter than you, faster than you and will do this to you and you will know then exactly what it feels like and no one will bbe there to helo, because by the time you get there, all your bridges will have been burnt and you will have nowhere to go.I wish death on no one. No one but you. The next time you feel suicidal, and you do I know, please, do the human race a favour and go through with it. I hate you, you are utter scum, you're not worth spitting on. I am better than you. I am good looking, inside and out, I have a wondderful personality, despite what the lies you have concocted about me say, I may not have a lover but that is my choice not because no one wants me. I have the best friends a woman could ask for, and I have my flaws but I work fucking hard to overcome them and it makes me a stronger person when I do. I'm not like you, cold, unfeeling and playing the martyr to get someones knickers off.

The only thing I ever did wrong wad ignoring my gut from day one and letting you force me into a first date. And at least I waited six weeks before I chose ti make love to you unlike you eho wanted it within hours of meeting and knowing what I know now if I had given in you would have used that to call me easy. Thank god I stuck to my guns.You're never likely to see this post seeing as you don't use your profile here anymore but I have found it cathartic to do. Because I know all of this will happen to you someday. Its a sad day when a man let's his past trauma rule his present and future the way you do, and chooses the path of hate and negativity to move on from it. I've been through more hell thanb you will ever know and I wouldn't change a second because it has made me a much stronger and better person.Time to love me for who i am again.
