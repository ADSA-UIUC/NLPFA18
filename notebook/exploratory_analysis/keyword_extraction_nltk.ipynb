    "text = \"Hey MarkYou say you change moods in the twinkling of an eye, and I would argue that is very rare in bipolar. Have you been formally diagnosed? I am interested that meds don't work at all. Sometimes this is indicative, not of bipolar, but of borderline personality disorder. You could look this up on the site on here. I am NOT diagnosing you, I cannot do that, of course, but the sudden swinging up and down as you feel is much more common in borderline. There is treatment for borderline, a specific therapy called DBT (not CBT). I know very little about it, but others know a lot. It may be an idea to check with your psychiatrist whether you have borderline, or that maybe they could look again at your symptoms. All of this is just a thought, and meds do not work on people with this disorder. There is hope honey. xx\""
