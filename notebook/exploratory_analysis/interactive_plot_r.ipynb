I started growing fruit and veg in pots on the patio at first. I tried to be a green gardener no pesticides this website is very good for that http://www.greengardener.co.uk/ It really does keep you fit and it helps you get out in the sun (when we have it) so you get lots of serotonin.

MY dad gave me some runner bean plants last week too!Oh no hun, that's not nice. I had the same with a so-called friend, who I ended up screaming at and calling a selfish bitch. Her husband's told her she doesn't need friends besides him, and she's doing what he says. Shame her kids have been affected too!                                                                 </td><td>bulbie                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

MY dad gave me some runner bean plants last week too!Oh no hun, that's not nice. I had the same with a so-called friend, who I ended up screaming at and calling a selfish bitch. Her husband's told her she doesn't need friends besides him, and she's doing what he says. Shame her kids have been affected too!                                                                  & bulbie                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n",

I tried to be a green gardener no pesticides this website is very good for that http://www.greengardener.co.uk/ It really does keep you fit and it helps you get out in the sun (when we have it) so you get lots of serotonin.

MY dad gave me some runner bean plants last week too!Oh no hun, that's not nice. I had the same with a so-called friend, who I ended up screaming at and calling a selfish bitch. Her husband's told her she doesn't need friends besides him, and she's doing what he says. Shame her kids have been affected too!                                                                  | bulbie                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \n",
