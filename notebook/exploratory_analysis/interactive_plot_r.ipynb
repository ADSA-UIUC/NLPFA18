I started growing fruit and veg in pots on the patio at first. I tried to be a green gardener no pesticides this website is very good for that http://www.greengardener.co.uk/ It really does keep you fit and it helps you get out in the sun (when we have it) so you get lots of serotonin.

I started growing fruit and veg in pots on the patio at first. I tried to be a green gardener no pesticides this website is very good for that http://www.greengardener.co.uk/ It really does keep you fit and it helps you get out in the sun (when we have it) so you get lots of serotonin.
