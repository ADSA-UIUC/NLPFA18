# NLP Healthcare Project

---

## Objective

Our goal is to use posts from mental health forums to identify people with similar backgrounds/concerns so they can identify 
with each other. We thought that this way, people undergoing depression/mental issues who simply need attention can receive
attention from individuals who understand what the person is going through.
