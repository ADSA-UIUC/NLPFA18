Your description of your CC, word for word, mirrors the shortcomings of one of the most inadequate CCs I have come across (who was not one of my own, but was the CC for a young female with acute needs, who I was working with). The CC was inadequate because he never conversed directly with the young person, in terms of things she wanted to talk about. Instead, he asked questions based on his poorly recorded, innaccurate notes from the previous meeting. We only received a draft copy of the previous meeting's notes at the start of the next meeting. He always tried to dodge issues around actions that he had failed to follow through, by blaming others, although the truth invariably came out at the CPA reviews. As there was no accurate recording of the content of appointments (despite reams of note taking) and no carrying out of agreed actions = no coordination of care = care plans that were never implemented = no care = constant risk instead of support.In the end, there was no option but to change the CC. The young person asked for a CPA review, where the change was agreed. She also asked for a female CC, as she felt this would enable her to approach a range of issues that she was uncomfortable addressing with males - even the most sympathetic males would not be able to fully understand and would be unable to empathise with her personal issues and feelings as a young woman.When she spoke about her new CC (female), it was in much the same manner as you speak about the young female member of staff.

The world may not like that, but that is not your problem.

This does not mean that it will always be a disabling component - it only impairs us when it acts as a driver to do risky things that might be harmful. Nobody seems interested in talking about impulsivity when it acts as a driver to do risky things that might help others - that is called bravery, courage, etc (i.e., like the case of those people, who acting on impulse, run towards what everyone else is 'standing back/running away from' to help someone - despite there being a potential risk of harm to themselves).The point of therapy where impulsivity is concerned is to get enough insight and self-management to be able to control the different emotional and psychological drivers involved in a more effective way.Drain on the NHS time and resources? - You would probably not even think to ask this if the question was about someone with a physically observable health condition, even if their prognosis was far worse - i.e., such as in cystic fibrosis. I think you would also be angered if anyone suggested that someone with a condition like cystic fibrosis should not receive treatment and therapy on the basis that it is incurable.Mental health services are already treated as 'cinderella services' in the NHS - and as patients with mental health conditions we are often treated as 'second or third class' citizens. This is also true for many mental health professionals.

Additionally, I had asked her specifically to use my mobile to contact me as a live in a shared house with no confidentiality. She didn't respect this and it put me in a difficult position. And left me feeling pretty angry. I get your feeling of sabotage because at this point I'm fighting the strongest urge not to walk away from everything (I know what it means for me if I do walk away so holding on by a thread).

She is still concerned about the risk and wants to see me again in 3 weeks. Also managed to talk with her about the comment she made about me continuing to work.

Because your brain isn't being truthful with you. When you're depressed your mind tells you lies. Like 'people would be better off without me, I'm such a burden to them, and such a cause of misery and worry, they'd be relieved not to have to put up with me any longer. They might be sad for a while or pretend to be more upset than they are, but deep down they'd be glad it's all over'. I've had these thoughts too, and a large part of me has truly believed them. Both before and since I've had children. But it's our minds deceiving us. It's not true at all. Everything I've read about the aftermath of suicide describes families and friends who  never stop feeling the effects . Who always wonder 'what else could I have done? Was it my fault they no longer wanted to live, am I in some way to blame? Why didn't I do x or say y? Why didn't I realise how much pain they were in, how much they were suffering? Why didn't I know that they really would go through with it?' I'm sorry if this comes across as blunt, but it's what really happens after suicide, in my own experience (I lost someone I loved through suicide), and in all I've read or heard about. And I think it's especially so for children of people who die by suicide. It doesn't matter what age they are, even if they're adult. They  always  wonder  what if ? What if there was something I could have done? What if I'd been there, what if I could have stopped them? What if I'd let them know how much they meant to me, and how much I needed and loved them? What if I'd have said the right words, or given the right support? What if I hadn't upset them so much? What if I'd been less trouble? What if I'm in some way responsible, what if I was part of the problem? What if, what if, what if?It's very hard not to feel guilty after someone you know or love ends their life by suicide. It's very hard not to feel you could have done more. I don't say any of this to make you feel bad, or make you feel guilty for coming to this conclusion that you truly want to die. I've been there, I've truly believed the same, and I already felt guilty enough, and enough of a failure at life, I didn't need people guilting me further. But if you really believe that it would be better for you to no longer be here, then sometimes one of the few things you can try to hold on to is how it would affect your family, and others who know, like or love you. Your mind will be telling you lies about how no one would be that upset, no one would care, everyone would heave a sigh of relief, or be secretly pleased. But they're  lies , convincing ones, but lies. They're not true. It's not how it really would be. People would be devastated. And they'd  always  remember you and miss you, especially your children. The pain wouldn't be forgotten, or eventually diminish. They wouldn't one day be able to carry on as if you'd never been in their lives. They just wouldn't. I've had to tell myself this when I've felt there was no option other than suicide. I've had to hold on to that when there wasn't much else to keep me here. When my mind has been trying to convince me that everyone would be  better off  without me here, I had to cling on to that small quiet niggling thought 'what if they're not?'.I'm sorry if I've gone on. I really hope there'll come a day when you can say 'I'm glad I decided to tough it out, I'm glad I found it in me to keep on keeping on'. I believe that day can come for you. It's so hard when there seems no one to reach out to (professionals I mean), and I'm sorry you've had bad experiences and been let down, but you  are  reaching out  here . And then again, what have you got to lose reaching out to professionals, you already feel as low as a person can feel? You might get some small help, you might find something useful. Even if nothing comes of asking for help, you have shown yourself that you can ask (as does posting here). And that signifies that some small part of you knows you deserve help, and would like help. And it shows some small grain of belief that help  could... just might,  make some small difference. Enough to keep you going another minute, another hour, another day. And that's all that's needed, to just take each minute, hour, day at a time, to get you through, until it gets less painful, which I believe it can, it has before (even though it might feel like it never will, again it's your depression's lies telling you that).Keep on with the distracting. I think that's a really good thing to do, as much as you can manage to.I'll stop now I've said enough, probably too much. I'm sorry if it's a bit much to read.

When I've been in a really bad place, mine has suggested seeing my GP whilst she is away, just to check in with somebody (realising it can't be the same as a therapy session, but rather just someone to touch base with). I can't remember whether I did, I don't think I was all that keen on the idea. And I know it's different with an uplanned absence that hasn't been anticipated. But with my permission she had written to my GP anyway (she showed me the letter first to check I was happy with it), to say that I was having a particularly difficult time, and might need extra support anyway, especially on weeks when she was due to be away. Depends on the GP (and your relationship with them), but some will understand that people seeing a therapist or psychologist might need extra support when that person is unavailable. It's a valid reason for an appointment. Maybe if you feel it would be appropriate for you you could ask, and explain you just need extra support?

Isn't therapy meant to be exactly the place where it's appropriate to express anger and hurt, and be way more emotional than you would elsewhere, a safe place to express these things, with it being understood it's not personal towards the therapist, and it's permitted to do so? Do you think fear is a factor in why you now don't want to go? Maybe fear that it really could help and change things (change can be scary even if it's change for the better not change for the worse). Fear that it will be 'too much' emotionally (a good therapist should be able to guard against this by keeping the pace to one that can be handled, so it doesn't become overwhelming, and providing good support when things do threaten to overwhelm you). Or maybe fear that it will make no difference, and all the time and hope you've invested in waiting for this to come around has been a waste of effort.

And nearly a month is a long time when sessions are usually weekly. Can you remind yourself that even when they're away, they haven't forgotten you, and they're still holding your needs and your distress in mind? They still care about you, even when they're not available to talk to. And they will keep their 'promise' to return, they are not abandoning you to cope alone. Are there things they've said that have helped that you could write down, that would help you stay safe, and help you maintain hope? Maybe you could write down each week the things you would raise in therapy if they were there, so you can still get out the things that are on your mind and can use them on their return, or maybe putting them in an email, even knowing you wouldn't get a reply. This might all give you a feeling of continuity and connection to the work you are doing.As regards the letter to your GP, is it the idea of ringing up that is daunting? I think it's unlikely the GP's would contact you with an appointment on the basis of the letter, but at least they'd not need the whole situation explaining if you went to see them. When my therapist wrote a letter like this explaining she was going to be away and I might want support from them, I was able to book a GP's appointment which felt in some small way that I was still connected to someone who was concerned about me and my welfare, even though they didn't have the skills my therapist does to help me. And it was evidence of my therapist's continuing care and 'holding me in mind' to make this contact with the GP. Could you perhaps send a copy of the letter if you have one by post to the GP with a note asking for an appointment, if asking in person or on the phone is difficult? You deserve help and acknowledgment that you are struggling, your need is legitimate, your GP should and most likely will understand that breaks in therapy can be a risky and difficult time. Mine did (even if not fully), and wanted to help, and it was somewhat helpful to have someone to touch base with in my therapist's absence, even though it wasn't in any way a replacement therapy session. I still felt alone without my regular therapy sessions, but it helped a little.

depression in the late 80s but the doctor who i see 2 months ago called it manic depression when i say chancge in minutes its not that 1 minute im happy then the niex sad its mainly just my thoughts i cant control them i always try to think possitive but i could be having a realy good day and suddenly my thoughts take over and twist my head about and make things bad to be honest i have seen so many doctors and psychiatrists over the years i gave up and started to just deal with my battle on my own had a realy bad turn 2 months ago and went to gas myself in my car had it all planed out got the pipe found the place and started to do it but managed to click out of it before it was to late i took this as a warning sign that i was out of control again so went to the doctors again was given more tablets and to be honest all the tablets do to me is make me feel stoned and i then lose my thoughts and feelings which i realy hate my thoughts get even lower and i realy do get low so stop taking them had 2 different types of tablets last month but both had the same affect on me when i tell the doc that he says i have to take them but i cant i get that low and very suicidle i cant lose the few possitive thoughts i cling to to keep me here or else i will end it all i have spent so long in this state i leant 90% control but still go overboard from time to time was ment to have councoling but they havent made me a appointment also told me i can only have 6 hours free then i will have to pay for it what a jokeso i guess i am on my own to deal with it again i do have my wife and family to support me but hate them seeing what it does to me as i push them away when i am bad and shut myself down cant stop it they learnt what happens to me aswell so they do know i cant help it but it hurts me so much to put them through it with me people dont seem to realise it affects all the people around you aswell i do work but some times it is so hard to stay focused all i think now after so long in this battle is that ime now 43yrs old so my life is running away and i getting older so i will pass away soon anyway sounds realy bad but thats what it has done to me just wish i could stop the pain for not only me but my complete family i used to deal with it on my own untill the last epesode 2 months ago then i opened up to my wife and started telling her my thoughts and righting them down on the time to change site letting her read my posts every day so she could see what is happening to me but i got the impression it was all to much for her as she got run down and kept crying so now i stoped and pulled back with telling her things for her own protection but there you go just a part of my life for you to look at i hope you are ok and well and once again thank you so much for taking

after themselfs now so it feels like my meaning in life has ended and find it hard to find a possitive focus now the images i have in my mind is i done my part on this planet so i now gained the right

in the late 80s but the doctor who i see 2 months ago called it manic depression when i say chancge in minutes its not that 1 minute im happy then the niex sad its mainly just my thoughts i cant control them i always try to think possitive but i could be having a realy good day and suddenly my thoughts take over and twist my head about and make things bad to be honest i have seen so many doctors and psychiatrists over the years i gave up and started to just deal with my battle on my own had a realy bad turn 2 months ago and went to gas myself in my car had it all planed out got the pipe found the place and started to do it but managed to click out of it before it was to late i took this as a warning sign that i was out of control again so went to the doctors again was given more tablets and to be honest all the tablets do to me is make me feel stoned and i then lose my thoughts and feelings which i realy hate my thoughts get even lower and i realy do get low so stop taking them had 2 different types of tablets last month but both had the same affect on me when i tell the doc that he says i have to take them but i cant i get that low and very suicidle i cant lose the few possitive thoughts i cling to to keep me here or else i will end it all i have spent so long in this state i leant 90% control but still go overboard from time to time was ment to have councoling but they havent made me a appointment also told me i can only have 6 hours free then i will have to pay for it what a jokeso i guess i am on my own to deal with it again i do have my wife and family to support me but hate them seeing what it does to me as i push them away when i am bad and shut myself down cant stop it they learnt what happens to me aswell so they do know i cant help it but it hurts me so much to put them through it with me people dont seem to realise it affects all the people around you aswell i do work but some times it is so hard to stay focused all i think now after so long in this battle is that ime now 43yrs old so my life is running away and i getting older so i will pass away soon anyway sounds realy bad but thats what it has done to me just wish i could stop the pain for not only me but my complete family i used to deal with it on my own untill the last epesode 2 months ago then i opened up to my wife and started telling her my thoughts and righting them down on the time to change site letting her read my posts every day so she could see what is happening to me but i got the impression it was all to much for her as she got run down and kept crying so now i stoped and pulled back with telling her things for her own protection but there you go just a part of my life for you to look at i hope you are ok and well and once again thank you so much for taking

and it pushed me right over the edge which is why i asked for help tryed to take my life 2 times but managed to stop myself at the last minute but yes totaly lost myself for around 1 month but yes here i am still fighting but i am running out of energy and my lows are lasting longer and longer and i am slowly giving up as if my batteries are now flat i do have support but feel i need to do it on my own for myself i am 43 and had this illness since i was 16yrs old i dont look faward no more as the future scares me and i defenatly try not to look back this site is great i was on time to change site and done 2 months diary for the doc but they closed the site and it s been deleted such a shame as it was when i was at my lowest thank you all for your support it realy does help me dont know how but it seems to take away some of the suffering just by posting on the site for other peoples views and like i always say to people only people who suffer the illness will understand me so

overload and have to shut my mind down at the moment i have no emotions crying inside and a hard exterior shell so no body can see how i realy feel can only focus on next 2 days no further very forgetful and permantly down inside i am learning more and more about my feelings and thoughts and have learnt loads over the 23 years but still cant control them i just end up blank and sleep for 1 day and night once it gets to much like recharging my batterys ready for the next battle with my mind this is a very crual illness to have and i realy dont know how i have managed to survive for so long with it and just find the power and strenth to keep batteling it day after day minute by minute and one of the worse things is you just cant seem to explain it to no one and if you do manage to explain parts of it to people they cant understand it as like i say to people only people who suffer will understand each other because we are in the same or very simular worlds but hey here i go

better life away from me and i am so messed up regarding this i feel as if i am punishing her for the way i feel dont think wrong of me i wouldent lay a finger on her or hit anyone but mental punishment is worse in my opinion and all i keep doing is pushing her away for her own benifit i am sick of draging her and my children down with me and i have spent last 6 months trying to change myself and stop it but it seems the harder i try the deeper i fall so maybe life on my own in my own messed up world is my only awnser but the next thing if i choose that path is i will see the hurt and tears from my wife and children and i realy dont think i can cope with that it will probely push me over the edge and end my life so i feel so traped in my world and cant find a way to sort it out so scared and mixed up and the fight i have with myself from the minute i wake is realy nackering me out cant find the energy to do anything else feel like the end of 28 now 29 years of fighting this

negitive once again and i have to push through the fellings but yes strugeling once again with no exit doctors just dont seem to want to test me no matter how many times i ask for help just chuck pills at me that make me worse i come to a point in my life now were all my children have grown up and having children of there own and the first 28yrs of my battle was focused on providing for them as there dad but hey they look after themselfs now so it feels like my meaning in life has ended and find it hard to find a possitive focus now the images i have in my mind is i done my part on this

emotionaly hurt the other person takes over me and I change like there is 2 of me , whilst this other side of me has control its as if ime traped inside me watching what is happening and I just cant shout out or ask for help or even talk I lose total control of myself and can only sit back and watch and listen it has beaten me up for years and I just cant win until the point I have no energy left so I have to sleep and totally shut down until it passes can take days sometimes it scares the hell out of me and I hate how it treats my family and friends not violence just total negitivety to them all when ime on my own I hear voices in my head and talk to them I am always on edge and scared when alone and just keep looking out the window hoping for some1 to come and be with me but when some1 does I just want them to piss off ? the minute they go I back in scared mode I can got to the shops no more , cant socialise , cant open up to people , find it real hard to express my emotions and feelings apart from hate , I just cant seem to control my mind any more or think straight I just trying to keep busy so I don't get time to sink any further or I may end my life if you can call it a life I wouldent but hey I hanaged to scream out at the doctor for help and help fast and it has worked just need to hang in here till the 8th which will feel as if ime on a new road to me and I will

putting my family through this with me I drag them all down with me and they all deserve so much better in life than they get with me my wife is just on edge 24/7 I can see it wondering if its me or my illness today I am such a loving careing person myself but such a arsehole when my illness takes over me starting to think I should go it alone and let them all live there lifes without me holding them back this feeling hurts me to hell but I got my results got the meds and once again doesent help and I struggle so much to keep control of myself it wears me out and I just lose in the end anyway so whats the fucking point in keep banging my head against a brick wall and hurting the ones I love like I said before its like ime in a bubble cant talk ,cant feel emotions,cant express emotions ,but what I can see is the hurt in the faces of the ones I love due to me being like this and I CAN FEEL THE HURT FROM THEM WITH IN ME which makes me worse ime so scared as my mind is just giving up and I only see 1 way to stop it and that's to end my sad sorry life 1 good thing is unlike before many months ago I still have tears and I can cry which meens my emotions haven't totally gone yet but all I feel is hurt and pain my life has become so difficult as I only have qauter of a life left 85% of the time inside ime off the rails and hurting myself everyone around me does there best to cheer me up and not make things worse for me but its with in my head and no matter what they do my head twists my life about and makes things worse I so hope u all find your way out of this illness and find meds

the issues and send me down it isent easy for any of us I just wish I had the help ime getting now 30 years ago it would have made it so much easyer for me to get through life you just have to push on with life best you can but be careful to give yourself some rest time to recharge urself all the best mark and don't give up its like a war the minute u give up its game over you lose battle on and slowely it will pass just need to find the best way u manage to cope mine is to keep myself busy and focused on things as if I stop and rest my mind it runs me down with bad images and bad thoughts

silly stupid riddle questions which done my head in and i just kept saying what ever is wrong or doing your head in just ask and talk to me stop with the mind games but she said no so i left and went

remember them laughing and it gives me so much joy.People leave our lives but they live on in us and it's there will that we carry on.Grieving, crying and feeling sad is natural and a cleaning

I was really shocked and cried more when she told me this, but she told me he was always with me, always watching over me and always helping me in small ways as best he could. I told her I wanted to die and go over to the spirit world and escape the pain I feel in life and she told me in no certain terms that he Didn't Want Me There yet, that it wasn't my time and I have things to do in this life and she helped me see that there might be some hope. Hearing that he was always with me doesn't change how much I miss his physical presence but it has gone a long way for me to see clearly that I am never alone and I can always talk to him in my mind and he will hear.I don't know how you feel about that, I don't want to cause you any more confusion or pain in any way shape or form, I just wanted to share my story with the possibility of it giving you a little hope that your mother is with you right now too and always will be until it is your time to join her. I also have prayed to be ill to leave this disastrous world and save myself from severe depression/ anxiety but perhaps we do have a time to go and it's not now, and perhaps we do have things to accomplish by being here... I don't know what this is - for me or for you, but I now have hope.I cannot imagine what you are going through, I cannot feel your pain, all I can do is send you a hug and wish you well and all I know is that my Grandad by my side only wants me to be well and happy and the last thing he wants is for me to hate my life and myself so much that I don't want to be here. I don't know how I get to that well and happy place yet, it's a long road, but maybe some joy might come in at some point. Maybe your mum would be sad to see you so unhappy too, not that that is any reason to want to live because you are clearly in extreme emotional pain, but just as you wished her well and life I am sure she would want the same for her beautiful daughter.

I couldn't shift them, and my house got infested. What I did was I continued to treat my cat. She'd get a flea tablet, they kill all the fells on the animal in a few hours. They literally just drop off, but some drop off alive and recover. To fix this, and any eggs or larvae in my carpets, I salted my carpets. It kills fleas too. They need 50% humidity to survive. You have to be careful not to let your carpets get damp, because it will take the moisture out of the air. I'd say if your house is quite humid, leave it for 24 hours. I left mine for 2 days. My carpets got a little damp but once I hoovered up all the salt it dried out. It'll clog your hoover a little, but I really worked. I also put warm water on a plate, with a squirt of washing up liquid and a candle in the middle. The warmth and light will attract the fleas, and they'll jump in the water and get dragged down by the washing up liquid. It's a great way to monitor your flea population. If you're worried about a fire hazard, use the LED ones, they'll still get attracted to it. I use hot water in my flea traps. This together worked beautifully. I've seen one in the last 3 weeks, and we were infested. It was bad. Hoovering is another brilliant weapon against fleas, as long as you remember to empty your hoover and put the waste outside. If you use flea tablets and then put on a repellant, it might work better than relying on the spot on to kill the fleas? Just kill the ones on the animal and make it not want to jump on?

It\\'s the ONLY thing resembling \"destiny\" that we have. I don\\'t subscribe to the idea that there is anything or anyone out there that will give us meaning. The Universe does not care about us, any more than a cardboard box might.My little sister just died on June 30, and my little brother is going to die later this year, thanks to Hepatitis B and C. Mom joked that my inheritance just tripled, but we\\'re really working to deal with this.I\\'ve had my bouts, where I wonder about the point, or why bother when it\\'s all meaningless. I\\'ve rambled about it all before, so I\\'ll try to refrain.The meaning of life is the meaning that you apply to it. If you want to make a difference, then you can volunteer. Go study a field where you might be able to improve the lives of others.If it\\'s truly meaningless to you, then at least do something for yourself. Take a shower. Play video games. Write something on the forum. Basically, I just described my morning.As for the \"point\" of life, I think that the point of life is like the point of a needle. It\\'s very small and focused, and it matters only to you. Your happiness, sadness, pain, joy, excitement... all of it is yours. You are the star of your own movie, just as everyone else is theirs. You may have no idea how many times you were a background player in someone else\\'s story, but it could be into the millions.Maybe nobody cares about you, or very few might. That\\'s nothing special. We give no thought to the 50,000 babies who die every single day from diarrhea due to unclean drinking water. And I\\'m sure they don\\'t think about us one bit, either. None of you knows me, so the likelihood of you caring in a way that would impact me would be most small.I figure that I\\'m in a pretty good place, relatively speaking. Sure, I could do myself in and be done with it. But the time that I have here is so relatively short. I\\'m not suffering from End Stage Renal Failure or a cancer of any kind. The time is short, and maybe pointless, so why not do something for me?Certainly, you deserve that for you. F**k the world, and any concept of meaning! YOU are here RIGHT NOW, and you can do something for you. Let go of what you believe SHOULD be, accept what is, and then you are free to move about and experience something.At the very least, Waverunner, you owe yourself some decent experiences. You owe yourself some help. You\\'re harming yourself because the physical pain distracts you from the emotional pain. It\\'s also why people drink too much, eat too much, do lots of drugs, binge-watch television, and so on.I have a painful past, so I understand. Maybe not as bad, but it\\'s not a contest. My little sister is dead, and my little brother is dying, because they were running from the pain. Instead of running or trying to cover it up, I decided to soak in it. I recognize that the times I was harmed are gone, as are the people who caused the harm, even if they didn\\'t know their neglect counted as harm.I refuse to give those past events and people more power by allowing them to f**k up my day today.So I\\'m going to do my best to rise above and do something for myself. Some days it\\'s easy. Other days, it\\'s damned near impossible, and I might binge-sleep all day. It happens, although more rarely than in the past. Those who say, \"It gets better,\" are liars. IT never gets better. YOU get better at dealing with IT.And sometimes we need some professional help to guide us outside of ourselves so that we can effective deal with IT and then put IT in its proper place.When people tell me to \"cheer up,\" I often feel compelled to punch them in the face. I don\\'t, of course. But that sentiment never works. Getting help works. Talking about it works. Coping with it works.Self-harm, booze, drugs, and other things are only band-aid solutions that fall off the first time they get wet.I hope that you can find it within yourself to at least seek out some external help in the form of a professional, because like everyone else, YOU deserve a decent day.I might live another 20 years, or I might live another 20 minutes.

Of course they have the variations, such as the more mild Bipolar II, Cyclothymia, Bipolar Spectrum, and Rapid Cycling.

Fortunately, after recently getting out of the hospital, I am alot more stable, yet still depressed, but only moderately. Several other things I can\\'t stress enough, if indeed you do have Bipolar disorder:(1) Get a regular scheduled amount of sleep; for example, go to bed at 11pm and wake up at 6am everyday of the week (that includes weekends).(2) Get some regular exercise...it doesn\\'t need to be very physical....even a 30 minute walk each daycan help regulate the endorphin level in your brain, thus improving your mood.(3) Always be honest with your Psychiatrist and Therapist about how you feel, and how your medicationsare helping or not helping you.(4) Never miss taking your medications.(5) And although it may sound silly, always try to fit in some fun activities that make you smile andlaugh; laughter soothes the soul!I hope things progress and get better for you!Cheers for now.'", "sentiments": {"Anger": 0.0, "Fear": 0.615319, "Joy": 0.543339, "Sadness": 0.7200840000000001, "Analytical": 0.550133, "Confident": 0.0, "Tentative": 0.532358}}, {"forum_name": "beenabattlefor28year", "time": "2012-09-10 02:45:00", "text": "b\"Hi Mark,I hear what you're saying, and I've been through many of the same things as you...I'm 58 now, and afterlong depressions (and treatment) over the years, in 2001, just after the 9/11 tragedy, I had my psychoticbreak which hospitalized me, and subsequently had the Doctor's re-diagnosing me as Bipolar I. I too havemany times had suicidal ideations, but fortunately, it too was the thought of leaving such an awful legacy for my wife and daughter. And, it still is a struggle, even though my depression for the past week has only been mild (the new meds I think are helping....yea!). Anyway, prior to going into the hospital, for years my sleep hygiene was almost non-existent...sometimes I wouldn't sleep for several days, other days, I would sleep 36 hours, and some days 1 to 4 hours, etc. That's one of the worst things a person can do to their body (sleep deprivation); and those of us that have Bipolar Affective Disorder, it is even worse... it can trigger manic episodes, anxiety or panic attacks, or cause you to sink into deeper depression.Strangely enough, during my recent 10 day hospital stay in the Veteran's Hospital psyche ward here in Atlanta, Georgia, I was (gently) forced to go to bed at 11pm, and wake at 6am. When I was finally released, I thought I would be able to follow through on my own with the same sleep schedule...but...old habits die hard...so this past 5 days, I'm back into my bad sleep habits, although it hasn't yet triggered any negative events (crossed fingers!). But I know I need to get back into a routine sleep schedule; it isn't always easy...I for example avoid going to sleep many times, since I tend to have violent dreams (revolving around the vietman war of which I'm a veteran). Other times I just get so obsessed with what I am doing (primarily using my computer), that I lose track of time and procrastinate.Long story short, if you can create a routine to allow you to get to bed at the same time, and wake at the same time, that will benefit you greatly I think. I recommend to stop watching television or playing video games an hour before bed. Make your bedroom a quiet peaceful place for sleep (intimacy is OK too, LOL). Then an hour before sleep time, head up to your bedroom, and get ready for bed. Maybe use 10 to 15 minutes before bed, and read an inspirational passage in a self help book, the bible (or other religious text if you're so inclined), or listen to a DVD specifically designed to aid in relaxing you and preparing you for a good nights rest.Regarding feeling alone...unfortunately, that comes as part of the package of depression, whether it be regular depression, or bipolar depression. That's why socializing is important. Try hard to do the things you know you need to in order to stay healthy. Let your loved ones, family and friends know of your illness, if you haven't yet done so. Of course this forum is a great tool too (I don't get out hardly at all, since I'm too disabled to work, and have lost interest in doing those things I once had a passion for). But I believe if you slowly try harder each day, to accomplish just one more goal, no matter how small it may seem, and remember to be thankful and congratulate yourself for doing it, you eventually will start feeling better (assuming you are on adequate medication and do get therapy). So as usual, I've written a novelette (LOL)...therefore I'll just say that here on the forum we care, and you'll always have someone who will try and help.Take care for now Mark!Cheers\"", "sentiments": {"Anger": 0.0, "Fear": 0.0, "Joy": 0.55719, "Sadness": 0.683499, "Analytical": 0.515883, "Confident": 0.0, "Tentative": 0.847894}}, {"forum_name": "beenabattlefor28year", "time": "2012-09-13 21:55:00", "text": "b\"Hi Mark,I'm sorry to hear you're in a bad space right now; however, it is greatly important that you focus on those good things in your life...specifically your family.

I truly believe if you shift your focus to the good in your life (and I know its not easy when you fell such despair), that it will slowly lift the shroud of depression. I've been in the same dark depths in the past, thinking they would never pass, and why the fuck keep on living...but they do pass, and things do improve.

You need to be among people...and I don\\'t mean just be in the same house or apartment with them (i.e. - your loved ones). Do they know the depth of despair you feel; I know you say you can\\'t talk to them about it...but you should. Do you have a therapist, or go to group therapy; both of these can be therapeutic. Are you currently working, or unemployed? If you\\'re unemployed (or retired), it can cause self-isolation to be that much easier to do...not a good thing. So, I stress very much, that you get out among people; and I find it more effective to get out of your home and socialize. Going for a daily walk in your neighborhood, if you\\'re not physical handicapped and can\\'t, will produce endorphins, which will naturally give your mood a lift. So, if you could do a 20 to 30 minute walk each day, and while doing so, just take in nature. If your neighborhood is too stressful for you, perhaps drive a short distance to a park, and walk there. You need to start involving yourself in life. I know with depression, one can lose interest in the things they used to enjoy, and ultimately self isolate to the point of suicide, as is your case. But we have to have courage, and try, regardless of how difficult and hopeless it seems. You should avoid the \"all or nothing\" mentality...its unhealthy. Give yourself permission to take small steps at first, slowly achieving things you would like to; you\\'ll find that after achieving a small milestone, it gives a lift, small but still a lift. Each any every other small goal met, lifts you more and more. But the first step is having the courage to try, and then taking the action.And last (without me going and reading your entire thread), the title of your thread \"Been a battle for 28 years with no medication\" implies you take no psychiatric medications.

One such option, ECT (Electro Convulsive Therapy), has been known to work for some medication resistant patients. The treatment is not at all as it was depicted in the film \"One flew over the cuckoos nest\". Now a days, they still strap you down, administer a muscle relaxer, then administer anesthesia prior to placing the probes on each side of your temples. Once the shock is administered it causes a seizure. The side effects are short term memory loss. In the states they administer 4 treatments over the course of 2 weeks (e.g. Tuesday, Thursday of each week). I met a Veteran while I was hospitalized in the Psyche ward recently, who said it is the only treatment that helps him. He mentioned the effect can last between 3 to 6 months before you need another treatment. I know it sounds extreme, but it is done alot more humanely than people think, and has a success rate that is documented. So, you might discuss this with your Psychiatrist as an option.

If that means you have spells where you need to withdraw then go with it. It you fight it and beat yourself up over it you\\'ll make it worse than it has to be. Easier said than done but see it as a process of learning to accept it rather than fight against it. Although it\\'s there beating yourself up makes it worse than it would ever be without being so hard on yourself. Practice not trying to stop but trying accepting it and not beating yourself up. I\\'ve been there - it doesn\\'t help. Worrying about going mad can be what sends you mad in the end. Be kind to yourself.This thread is my approach to some of the experiences I\\'ve had. I\\'ll lie down or sit down and just focus on my breathing and my heartbeat (which will be pumping out my chest) and just try and root myself in it and \"watch\" my thoughts and accept and experience whats happening to me. It\\'s referred to as mindfulness, and meditation can be a good way of controlling anxiety and becoming calmer. It\\'s not for everyone but looking up the people I refer to in one post on youtube might be worth a try. Sometimes it\\'s worth trying things that might feel a bit different and outside our comfort zones. I wouldn\\'t have imagined me doing this stuff as a young tearaway lol, but it\\'s proved very useful. Some people who used to know me would piss themselves at some of the stuff I try now. It might not be for you, but no harm in trying something like that and finding out - I tried yoga and felt like an idiot, feeling like an idiot made me laugh, as did how inflexible I was. Turned to that helped more than yoga lol. Some stuff works in mysterious ways.Some exercise is another useful tool, especially when you least feel like it. If it wears you out and you sleep that\\'s a great result too. Cutting down on bad foods like sugar and caffeine and things like that will help if you don\\'t just do it all at once!!!Also keep that in mind about your wife. Unresolved decisions take up mental energy that we need. Thinking about whether people are better off without you is one of those types of decisions. She\\'s a big girl, she can make her own. She has the options and limiting someones options like that doesn\\'t make them happier. And thinking about that decision doesn\\'t do you any good either. Resolve that decision by saying and affirming that it\\'s not yours to make. Imagine the other way round - you\\'d want to be there and so does she. It would make you unhappier not to be allowed to not happier. If ever she doesn\\'t, she wont - but that\\'s her choice. Don\\'t end it on her behalf, it\\'s not the \"right\" thing to do - it\\'s a thing that makes her life worse.Best thing you can do for her and the kids is focus on yourself, especially when you\\'re really struggling.Do you have any strategies for calming yourself? What do you think you should do when this happens? Like if you were to make a plan of what to do what would it be? A plan can help because then you know what to do when you start losing it - it\\'s hard to decide once you\\'re there.What things do you do that relax you whether you\\'re struggling or not? Maybe you need to make more an effort to make time and do them more often to help prevent getting to this stage. Oh - and eat something if you haven\\'t yet man! Just something light, try some soup or something if you don\\'t want anything heavy.

The thing is this. The problems you've had, they effected your wife also. There is a process she needs to go though, and you need to respect it. It moves at a different pace and in different ways to the one you ideally wish, but you are two different people and have experienced the relationship from different angles. This is natural.My own view is I would not interpret it the way you have. If she felt that way I don't believe she would be spending this time enjoying herself with you and at the same time speaking about healing the relationship and trying to rebuild things at the deeper levels.What I would interpret that as saying, is that although things are going well, and you are enjoying time together, there are residual issues from what's gone before that still effect her. She may well be hurting still from the things she/you both has/have gone through, and to me it's a prod that hey, mark, at some point we need to discuss and work on these, they won't just go away for me. I've been effected, please don't pretend they just disappear for me, I'll need your help with them, and for you to respond to how I feel, for us to have what I need. = Otherwise I can't do this, because I need that.My advice is that at some point you will have to listen and understand and validate and react positively to what she has been through over these years. Without taking it personally. And she's telling you this. When the time comes, let her have her say - in whatever way she needs, and try not to take it personally or make it about your views, concentrate on hers. Appreciate that the same event viewed from two different angles has two separate lives. I like to explain it like this. Place a vase of flowers between two people. Ask each to draw a picture of them. The pictures will differ, yet each will have been drawing their truth and each picture is of equal validity. It's the same thing, but viewed from different angles it takes on a different form.For reconciliation in a relationship their needs to be shared understanding and respect for each others picture. Each needs to able to show it and have it respected and understood without judgement and without the other trying superimpose their own picture over the others. If you've had the problems you've had for 28 years, it is implicit in the mere fact she's stood by you for so long she's done a lot of this for your picture. If you feel well, or even less unwell, one of the valuable and healing things you can do is to spend some time doing the same for hers. We, if we are fortunate enough to recover, need to understand that for others ... the same break in events does not occur. They feel essentially the same as they did yesterday, whereas you may not. That needs to be respected.She wants to tackle those issues and hurt because she loves and wants to be with you. It's when someone doesn't that the relationship is over. Arguments/debate/antagonism, struggling for the right word there ... expressing different points of view on things - they are a sign that someone still cares. That they are trying to make things the way they need them to be. Don't misinterpret those things as not caring, or as criticism. What she wants is to heal, not to distance, and those comments are telling you how important that process is to her and your relationship That's imo, from here - and is not meant as criticism of you either, I think you're a really nice guy doing his best and this is all meant in a friendly tone, it's just that you seem like you would like to forget the past (fully understandably), but your wife has not had the same significant change in herself that you have, which means you'll have to work through that stuff with her or else it will look to her like you don't care - no matter how much effort you direct towards looking the direction you want to look. You show you care by looking where she needs to look at at times too, even when you don't want to. In fact, especially when you don't want to.___________I'd also suggest that you push for someone to talk to about your own experiences. Can take a lot of working out this stuff that's gone on and is going on, I think you'd benefit from counselling. You've shut down for a period of time emotionally from what I can read, and the return of those emotions takes some steering and dealing with at times, as you appear to be experiencing yourself. In your position, I'd want that support and would I benefit from it.

I understand, because I have been battling the depression and mood swings, for my entire life. Unfortunately, it seems that the fight does not get any easier as I age. I suspect it may be the same with you. I also have children and fortunately, I was able to work the majority of my life, but it has been a struggle. Medications did help me quite a lot for some time, but stopped working. I am now quite depressed and really cannot function very well. You are fortunate that your family is so patient and understanding with you. Really, you are fortunate. My behavior and mood swings destroyed my family life, which is understandable.I understand how many pills did not work for you. I have had bad side effects with meds and they stopped working for me as well. For me, I need to try to find a solution. To accept this terrible existence with no hope for change, would make it very difficult to keep going. I have read of some newer techniques for treatment resistant depression. I will give them a try and keep you posted. It seems Ketamine is a possible solution. There are also some new meds Brexillin is one.
