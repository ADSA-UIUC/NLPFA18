471,Gajolene,"b""Brian before I was brave enough to share what was going on with me to anyone, I would just journal anything that was in my head, no matter how depressing, or cycling. It could be poetry, imaginary letters to people who had hurt me, letters asking for forgiveness, sometimes doodles, anime cartoons, big scrawls. Anything that would get what I was feeling out of my head. I used to live in sever physical pain 24/7 too, for three years, anytime of day or night, the same excruciating pain, I tryed so many different pills and nothing worked. Writing it might be enough to get you through you temptation to do something. Have you thought about writing down what your feeling to give to the doctors so you don't have to say it out loud. I did this several times and it works. It's very hard to trust people when your feeling so low, we are here and we're willing to listen but if you can't get this under control you should get yourself into a hospital. I had to do it for myself, I had no-one to turn to either and I hadn't discovered forums yet. The lonliness was terrible a deep dark blackness of dispair, my kids had relocated away and I couldn't turn to anyone I knew. My partner at the time withdrew and abandoned me. I wrote it all out, It looked all disjointed and confusing, I had no idea of how to write it out uniformly so I just wrote out what I felt in bits and peices and walked into emergency at the hospital and told them I couldn't cope, I wanted to harm myself and I needed help. When they asked if I was suicidal I nodded my head. I couldn't answer but I just nodded. I handed them the paper. They took it from there and admitted me for four days and put me on SSRI's and an additional anti-psych lowdose. It wasn't a grade school essay I had written but it was enough for the doctors to know how much pain physical and mental and how deep and desperate my depression was.Maybe we can help give you the courage to be able to tell someone how your feeling. Start with telling us, You've already started, your confused, your lost, your in unbearable pain and your having suicidal thoughts.Remember to suicidal thoughts are not actions, try to keep them from becoming actions. Keep reaching out there are good people out there who are willing to help you to get better, and feel better.""",0.0,0.0,0.564427,0.680772,0.0,0.0,0.829755

It's depressing when you don't know what the hell is happening to you with panick attacks. Between that and your leg problems, coping alone I can see why you fell into such a deep depression. You really should talk to your doctor about it. I know lots on here post against medication but when you are this low and really messed up sometimes SSRI's can be a life saver and make a really big difference in how you feel. It's hard to accept when you can't handle it alone on willpower, but if you can and can muster up the courage to ask for help there is lots of support out there, and counselling to help you learn how to cope and manage when your emotions get to be so overwhelming. A lot here including me have felt just like you are now, we can help give you hope and courage to get that help and begin recovering and feeling better.

668,Gajolene,"b""The reason I thought those things was because growing up I had no encouragement or guidance from my family to teach me to be self confident, My family was big on critisizing, guilt trips, being cold and insensitive to crying and such, was not on loving, supportive envirornment. I was bullied at school incessantly to from Kindergarden to grade 9 I was the favorite school pick on, I was a very insecure, shy person, never fought back an easy target for bullies. No one had ever taught me to defend myself or to ignore hurtful comments. If I told I was told not to be a cry baby or toughen up or some other stupid comment.I had to teach myself to be strong and confident and to realize really I was a good, valuble, person and that I did deserve respect, trust, dignity and honor. That I could learn to have all those things I only dreamed of having but never knew how to get. Only after my life had become a complete mess as an adult, did I begin to realize, no one was going to swoop in and save the day for me. Only then did I start to see it. Only then did I realize a lot of things happening really weren't my fault, I had no way of knowing how to do those things because noone had ever taught me, protected me, encouraged me or cared for me as a child. So it wasn't my fault, it was they're fault I had turned out that way. I was a child and it should of been they're job to teach me. Now as an adult I could and still can change a lot of those things that make me think terribly about myself, I strive every day to do my best and learn more to become happier, stronger and more confident.

805,Esquire,"b""I'm really sorry to hear this Brian. I came back because I'm not do well at all myself and feel much in the way you do and throwing in the towel. And now to read this. I 'll save the normal cheerful bullshit I know you don't particularly care for much. I just hope you are holding on to life, because you deserve to be on this earth as much as anybody else. Its not our fault we have MH issues. You were one of the few people here that reached out to me, and I never forgot that. Please feel free to PM me anytime. Keep ur head up.""",0.60406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.804834,0.0,0.79734
