2,calypso,"b""Hey MarkYou say you change moods in the twinkling of an eye, and I would argue that is very rare in bipolar. Have you been formally diagnosed? I am interested that meds don't work at all. Sometimes this is indicative, not of bipolar, but of borderline personality disorder. You could look this up on the site on here. I am NOT diagnosing you, I cannot do that, of course, but the sudden swinging up and down as you feel is much more common in borderline. There is treatment for borderline, a specific therapy called DBT (not CBT). I know very little about it, but others know a lot. It may be an idea to check with your psychiatrist whether you have borderline, or that maybe they could look again at your symptoms. All of this is just a thought, and meds do not work on people with this disorder. There is hope honey. xx""",0.0,0.0,0.527863,0.564941,0.583966,0.0,0.863905
3,madmark,b'thank you for your reply no i dont have bipolar many years ago i was told i was suffering from cronic depression this was when not alot was known regarding depression in the late 80s but the doctor who i see 2 months ago called it manic depression when i say chancge in minutes its not that 1 minute im happy then the niex sad its mainly just my thoughts i cant control them i always try to think possitive but i could be having a realy good day and suddenly my thoughts take over and twist my head about and make things bad to be honest i have seen so many doctors and psychiatrists over the years i gave up and started to just deal with my battle on my own had a realy bad turn 2 months ago and went to gas myself in my car had it all planed out got the pipe found the place and started to do it but managed to click out of it before it was to late i took this as a warning sign that i was out of control again so went to the doctors again was given more tablets and to be honest all the tablets do to me is make me feel stoned and i then lose my thoughts and feelings which i realy hate my thoughts get even lower and i realy do get low so stop taking them had 2 different types of tablets last month but both had the same affect on me when i tell the doc that he says i have to take them but i cant i get that low and very suicidle i cant lose the few possitive thoughts i cling to to keep me here or else i will end it all i have spent so long in this state i leant 90% control but still go overboard from time to time was ment to have councoling but they havent made me a appointment also told me i can only have 6 hours free then i will have to pay for it what a jokeso i guess i am on my own to deal with it again i do have my wife and family to support me but hate them seeing what it does to me as i push them away when i am bad and shut myself down cant stop it they learnt what happens to me aswell so they do know i cant help it but it hurts me so much to put them through it with me people dont seem to realise it affects all the people around you aswell i do work but some times it is so hard to stay focused all i think now after so long in this battle is that ime now 43yrs old so my life is running away and i getting older so i will pass away soon anyway sounds realy bad but thats what it has done to me just wish i could stop the pain for not only me but my complete family i used to deal with it on my own untill the last epesode 2 months ago then i opened up to my wife and started telling her my thoughts and righting them down on the time to change site letting her read my posts every day so she could see what is happening to me but i got the impression it was all to much for her as she got run down and kept crying so now i stoped and pulled back with telling her things for her own protection but there you go just a part of my life for you to look at i hope you are ok and well and once again thank you so much for taking the time to reply to me here is a link to the month i was on time to change go take a read then you will see more about how it affects my life  http://www.facebook.com/#!/topic.php...99&topic=19270 ',0.0,0.0,0.0,0.862299,0.0,0.0,0.0
4,maxitab,"b'Hi madmark. Twenty eitght years ago doctors were not very refined in their ability to diagnose, and to be honest, I would agree with mayfair, that this sounds much more like BPD to me than just about anything else. Have you looked at the criteria/symptoms. Many of us who have BPD do not respond to medication, but there are now a few very effective treatment ( not meds) options. If this were me I would go to my GP and ask for a proper assessment with a clinical psychologist and put down the manic depression label, since it is not, IMO true for you. Once you have a better idea of what is going on you will be able to access help. It is out there, why go on suffering?'",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.643494,0.585171,0.0,0.692997

6,maxitab,"b""HI again mark. I am supposing the isolation is due to anxiety, it sounds like it.First, I do need to ask, do you want things to be different? Because anxiety is a symptom of something that is going on that is not being addressed. Also, are you in the UK because being given a phone number for counselling does not sound like the UK....There is a service called IAPT which your GP can refer you to - is this it? If you are getting no result then you need to insist! Phone again and say you want to speak to the manager of the service and explain that you never get the promised appointment and ask who you can make a complaint with. It is amazing how people respond when you get a little pushy!In addition, there is some good help on line for anxiety, however, it is no good looking at it and thinkint 'that won't work for me' you have to be prepared to suspend your judgement and actually do it. If you want to try it,  www.anxietycoach.com Good luck. Don't suffer in silence.""",0.0,0.603198,0.500622,0.0,0.734268,0.0,0.0

9,maxitab,"b""Mark, did you look at any of the link I posted?What did you think of the suggestion that this may well be untreated BPD? I don't want to be or appear to be unsympathetic, but if it is BPD then I do feel you need to give the new more modern and aware Mental Health Service a second chance ( because you will be giving yourself a second chance along the way).Just because they failed you in the past is not a reason for staying angry at them. If you always do what you have always done - you will always get what you have always got. Try something new.

10,madmark,b'yes maxitab have checked out your link thank you it has made me understand sort of and what i did learn which i dident know is that thyroid malfunction can cause this problem like i posted i started to suffer from depression badly in the late 80s but managed to gain control of it up to about a yr ago then started to suffer realy bad again and yes seeked help from gp as i couldent work out what was wrong with me and why i lost control after so long had tests and found thyroid malfunction so i am on treatment for this with regular blood checks but still cant gain control of my depression have seen the doctor 3 times in the last 3 months regarding these problems but just pills that dont work i am fighting it hard myself and when i do get down i do look at possitives in life and talk to people regarding my problems but realy does take a couple of days batteling with myself before i can do this i have to pick myself up to a strong enougth state before i open up to anyone but normaly by that time i have so much going through my head its hard to explain what realy went on its just a jumbled mess in my mind i got the letter today funny enougth regarding 6 hrs of free counselling with iapt team i was refered to them by the wpct wellbeing service as they said my situation was to bad for them to treat me so now got to deside wether i think 6 hrs can sort out 28 yrs of my suffering so how i dont think so and i can not afford \xc2\xa350 per hour after my free session a i found the link well usefull thank you for that and i hope u and all the other members reading this post are all ok thank you',0.0,0.0,0.0,0.920313,0.582999,0.0,0.0

The thing about the IAPT is that though they say 6 hours, they have the ability to extend it or to refer you to a different form of therapy if they think you need it, so though the 6 hours sounds silly, it could be good for what it may lead in to.I know one of the things lots of people do is to say they are OK when they are not so don't pull any punches with the therapist, say how things really are for you.I do hope you can get some ongoing help..........""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.52002,0.0,0.950311

I find it helps to try & get as many angles on all this as possible - multiple personal & environmental perspectives - social, spiritual, psychological, & biological. For me things are primarily psychological & spiritual - & that seems to make most sense.I recently read the book 'in case of spiritual emergency' by Catherine Lucas - & really enjoyed it. Try some Google searches for 'Dark Night of the Soul' & 'Depression & Spirituality'. There is a PDF file here which is a good read as well -  http://www.mentalhealthforum.net/for...l-Explanations I'm not trying to convince you of anything.

93,madmark,b'its been a while i feel i am heading for another big downer and i am struggling to keep control my emotions and thoughts are all over the place and i have bad thoughts just going round and round in my mind screwing me up why is it always the ones i love that mess my head about i have became so insecure in my marrage i feel i want to leave and devorce my wife i know she would be happyer and have a better life away from me and i am so messed up regarding this i feel as if i am punishing her for the way i feel dont think wrong of me i wouldent lay a finger on her or hit anyone but mental punishment is worse in my opinion and all i keep doing is pushing her away for her own benifit i am sick of draging her and my children down with me and i have spent last 6 months trying to change myself and stop it but it seems the harder i try the deeper i fall so maybe life on my own in my own messed up world is my only awnser but the next thing if i choose that path is i will see the hurt and tears from my wife and children and i realy dont think i can cope with that it will probely push me over the edge and end my life so i feel so traped in my world and cant find a way to sort it out so scared and mixed up and the fight i have with myself from the minute i wake is realy nackering me out cant find the energy to do anything else feel like the end of 28 now 29 years of fighting this illness is getting near time for me to stop all the hurt the only way i know how but still hanging in here for a little while longer looking for awnsers i cant seem to find i am having counsoling at the moment for another 3 weeks and i realy do want to see the report and results from that to close this chapter and hopefully have a few awnsers to what has fucked my whole life up from a young age my life has been one big figth with myself(stomp)',0.0,0.0,0.0,0.595171,0.0,0.0,0.0

97,creamcheese,"b""Hi MarkNice to see you back on the forum.I can relate to you in many ways. I used to be on medication for my depression and like you, found it made me worse. Tried counselling as well but the counsellor didn't help me.What I found help me, was writing about my feelings in a diary. When I was going through my depressive moments, a lot of what was going on around me left me feeling confused. When I wrote about it, with my feelings etc. Reading through it actually made me see things differently. Writing about my feelings, day events in a diary is like therapy for me.Another tool was having a strong supportive network of people around me. Like family and friends. Talking to someone who is non-judgemental really helped me. Especially when I spent most of my life in a shell, not opening to anyone about my feelings. Everyone is different. Different tools help different people. Once you have access the right resources, recovery can take place.What do you feel helps you to control your depression?P.S It's nice to meet you Mark.Take careBecky""",0.0,0.0,0.578014,0.659179,0.0,0.0,0.900556

106,opendoorpsychiatry,"b""Hello MadMark,I am joining this thread very late, but I can see that you have been having a very difficult time. It sounds as if that medicines haven't really helped you so far, and the counselling is coming to an end and you are still feeling awful.I would suggest going back to your GP to explain how things just aren't getting any better. It is really important for them to know about the suicidal thoughts you have had so that they can ensure that you get the sort of help you need (by the way I don't mean being sectioned to hospital - that very rarely happens to people with depression these days). I wonder if you might benefit from having another go with a psychiatrist? They can help make the proper diagnosis and may be able to receommend treatmetns which your GP can't access.I hope things start to improve soon. Life always looks very bleak when one is depressed, but it doesn't have to be that way and most people find something which helps, though it can be a painfully slow business getting there.Best wishes,Andy""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.706393,0.777108,0.0,0.678973

All I can say is to get on an anti-depressant that works I know that anti-depredssants aren't always the answer and finding the right one is hard.Arapax (think that's how it's spelt) worked for me as I wanted to throw myself in front of a truck I was so bad but what stopped me was the thought of what it would do to my son. I left my husband and my son decided to live with his dad as my illness freaked him out.I have to live without seeing my son grow up it's so hard living apart from my son he lives in Australia. I think that's worse than my illness though I get through everyday. God I thought i had it hard but you really have things way worse than me. Just don't do anything silly as you have a whole family to think of. Shit I know about depression it's such an ugly thing but it's not worth giving up as things can't get any worse for you.

Is there anywhere you can get psychotherapy or counselling for free? It may be worth ringing Mind or the Samaritans to ask them. If you don't get on with tablets your only other option is some kind of counselling or psychotherapy. I know you've had six sessions but that hardly even scratches the surface, you need much much more. You could try going to your GP, telling him you suffer with suicidal thoughts and asking to be referred to the Community Mental Health Team for your area. Also I would definitely ring your local Mind group to find out what services are available to you. You need help and it might take some running around to find it. Stay strong and keep posting.

In my state the drug laws for narcotics are draconian, so doctors won't prescribe them. That's why I don't sleep, too much pain. So, I try to fill my days up with lots to keep my mind off what is going on with my body, but that is changing what is going on with my mind. Hard to be pleasant and nice. I still have hope that someone will help me, I just have to find the right doctor.""",0.0,0.0,0.633071,0.658681,0.517873,0.0,0.0

197,aircav,"b'Mark,is there any hobbies or anything at all that you have really enjoyed in the past.If there is than perhaps you could rekindle this pursuit.If not then try to think of something(anything)you can enjoy.I do not like to even leave my place but I make myself walk my dog each am and pm and look at the birds and animals,(quite a selection in florida) , or even just the trees.There are days when I am totally depressed and my only clear thought is YOU MUST DO SOMETHING NOW,because if I do not I will end up in the hospital again so I go in my home gym and throw weights around for an hour and a half and maybe some treadmill.It increases my feel good hormones so I am able to control the severe negativity.Medication helps but does not do it all.Wish I could help you get meds but it is vital to have a doctor involved.They can try different types to help alleviate some of the really bad feelings.We can tell your really a good man but unfortunately you have an illness similar to many of us.Most people do not understand unless they experience our situation.Every day I have to be on guard not to offend or yell or gripe.I just tell myself to shut my mouth and suck it up.I have always been a bipolar1/psychotic and perhaps that condition got me through the army.I was in the U.S.army 5th special forces group 67-70.Yeah it added ptsd to my list but its just one more thing.We can handle this challenge.We just get up clean up and reinforce ourselves especially if no one else is and say I can do this,I can make it.If others can do it so can I.Mark you have a large and good family that cares about you and probably have researched about your condition so they understand. Please do not let anything defeat you,not even yourself.Just keep placing one foot in front of the other until you get where you want to be.People on here can relate and are behind you because we care.Please remember what I told you MARK,your a bright light in the universe even if you cannot see it.I have to work out and prepare some lunch.Take care my friend,see you soon.
