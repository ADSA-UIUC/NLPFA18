197,aircav,"b'Mark,is there any hobbies or anything at all that you have really enjoyed in the past.If there is than perhaps you could rekindle this pursuit.If not then try to think of something(anything)you can enjoy.I do not like to even leave my place but I make myself walk my dog each am and pm and look at the birds and animals,(quite a selection in florida) , or even just the trees.There are days when I am totally depressed and my only clear thought is YOU MUST DO SOMETHING NOW,because if I do not I will end up in the hospital again so I go in my home gym and throw weights around for an hour and a half and maybe some treadmill.It increases my feel good hormones so I am able to control the severe negativity.Medication helps but does not do it all.Wish I could help you get meds but it is vital to have a doctor involved.They can try different types to help alleviate some of the really bad feelings.We can tell your really a good man but unfortunately you have an illness similar to many of us.Most people do not understand unless they experience our situation.Every day I have to be on guard not to offend or yell or gripe.I just tell myself to shut my mouth and suck it up.I have always been a bipolar1/psychotic and perhaps that condition got me through the army.I was in the U.S.army 5th special forces group 67-70.Yeah it added ptsd to my list but its just one more thing.We can handle this challenge.We just get up clean up and reinforce ourselves especially if no one else is and say I can do this,I can make it.If others can do it so can I.Mark you have a large and good family that cares about you and probably have researched about your condition so they understand.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.726276,0.0,0.0,0.624449
