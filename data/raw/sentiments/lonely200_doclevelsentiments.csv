That's why I like forums, they make me feel less lonely and just the kindness of having someone reply with empathy and encouragement is enough to make me feel a little better. Are you lonely because you're alone? Or do you feel lonely even when you're around others? I have social anxiety and depression which means meeting people is difficult, and I find that I don't 'play well with others' as my parents like to say.

You are probably so down at the moment that you don't even realise when someone likes you or are showing an interest/checking you out! I know it can suck being single, especially if all your friends have someone, but take solace in the fact that I've been single for five years! Not even a date...  Also, if you are single then you can take advantage of that time to do things that you want to do without the responsibility of having another to worry about.
