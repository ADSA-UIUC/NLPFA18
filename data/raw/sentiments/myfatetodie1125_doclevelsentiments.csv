I identify with what you've said about medication, it's very difficult when you feel you are a lone voice against a consensus. I've been persuaded many times into medication I didn't want to take and didn't believe would help (it didn't in my case). You've a right to your opinion on what you think will help, and if that's talking treatment rather than drugs they shouldn't view this as being uncooperative (they shouldn't, but unfortunately might). They can't force medication on you unless you're sectioned and admitted ( or I suppose they could force you by refusing other help unless you take them). But I hope you can manage to keep asserting what you feel is best for you, I wish you strength to be able to do that.

The assessment was supposed to be complete but she was so concerned about me after the last appointment that she wanted time to consider things and also talk to the cmht. She felt that the crisis team should be involved and she wants me seen by a Pdoc. I currently have an appointment in July (as a result of her referring me after our first appointment) which I had planned on cancelling anyway. I don't want any involvement with cmht, just the therapy. I have generally stayed under the radar of cmht but the couple of experiences I have had haven't left me feeling very optimistic. THe most recent being my cpn not turning up for an appointment and not following up until my GP contacted her at which point she blamed me for getting the arrangements for the appointment wrong (I know I didn't). Additionally, I had asked her specifically to use my mobile to contact me as a live in a shared house with no confidentiality. She didn't respect this and it put me in a difficult position. And left me feeling pretty angry.

Others can though Any news on when your psychologist will be back? I hope it's not going to be a lengthy absence. It's really difficult when a therapist is away, it can really throw things. When I've been in a really bad place, mine has suggested seeing my GP whilst she is away, just to check in with somebody (realising it can't be the same as a therapy session, but rather just someone to touch base with). I can't remember whether I did, I don't think I was all that keen on the idea. And I know it's different with an uplanned absence that hasn't been anticipated. But with my permission she had written to my GP anyway (she showed me the letter first to check I was happy with it), to say that I was having a particularly difficult time, and might need extra support anyway, especially on weeks when she was due to be away. Depends on the GP (and your relationship with them), but some will understand that people seeing a therapist or psychologist might need extra support when that person is unavailable. It's a valid reason for an appointment. Maybe if you feel it would be appropriate for you you could ask, and explain you just need extra support? I've never felt my recent GPs have really 'got' it with what I struggle with. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. I had one years ago who did, but then she was looking into stopping being a GP and training as a psychotherapist. You've been in my thoughts, sorry I haven't been able to reply for a few days. You are far from useless, I have a lot of respect for, and identification with, you  You do show strength in what you have been through. Please hold on, as you say your support networks are up in the air, but when they become more stable and trustable again, things will feel different. It may be that friends you have pushed away may still be waiting in the wings, unsure what would help or whether you'd like contact, but would be willing to still reach out to you if they knew what they could do, and that you would like them to.

692,AliceinWonderland,"b""Why not go just for the one appointment and tell them how angry you are? Have a rant at them for how long you've had to wait, how ignored and forgotten you've felt. If you see it as going just the once, then it's not as if you're making a long-term commitment, but you might reassess and decide you're able to go again. Isn't therapy meant to be exactly the place where it's appropriate to express anger and hurt, and be way more emotional than you would elsewhere, a safe place to express these things, with it being understood it's not personal towards the therapist, and it's permitted to do so? Do you think fear is a factor in why you now don't want to go? Maybe fear that it really could help and change things (change can be scary even if it's change for the better not change for the worse). Fear that it will be 'too much' emotionally (a good therapist should be able to guard against this by keeping the pace to one that can be handled, so it doesn't become overwhelming, and providing good support when things do threaten to overwhelm you). Or maybe fear that it will make no difference, and all the time and hope you've invested in waiting for this to come around has been a waste of effort. I'm worried about you having impulsive suicidal thoughts. Are you able to keep yourself as safe as possible, removing anything that you could be tempted to use to harm yourself, or keeping yourself away from situations where you could take impulsive action? Can you have some sort of plan for what to do when these impulsive thoughts happen, like telling yourself 'I'll wait x amount of time and see then whether I still feel the same'? Or could you resolve to post here or ring the Samaritans, or NHS 111, or someone you know, before doing anything impulsive, just to give yourself a bit of time to reconsider? Please don't harm yourself, I know you struggle to see the good things about yourself that other people can see, but I think a lot of you, and I really want you to still be around, and to have the chance for things to change for you.

726,AliceinWonderland,"b""It's hard when there are breaks in therapy and you don't have them to talk to. And nearly a month is a long time when sessions are usually weekly. Can you remind yourself that even when they're away, they haven't forgotten you, and they're still holding your needs and your distress in mind? They still care about you, even when they're not available to talk to. And they will keep their 'promise' to return, they are not abandoning you to cope alone. Are there things they've said that have helped that you could write down, that would help you stay safe, and help you maintain hope? Maybe you could write down each week the things you would raise in therapy if they were there, so you can still get out the things that are on your mind and can use them on their return, or maybe putting them in an email, even knowing you wouldn't get a reply. This might all give you a feeling of continuity and connection to the work you are doing.As regards the letter to your GP, is it the idea of ringing up that is daunting? I think it's unlikely the GP's would contact you with an appointment on the basis of the letter, but at least they'd not need the whole situation explaining if you went to see them. When my therapist wrote a letter like this explaining she was going to be away and I might want support from them, I was able to book a GP's appointment which felt in some small way that I was still connected to someone who was concerned about me and my welfare, even though they didn't have the skills my therapist does to help me. And it was evidence of my therapist's continuing care and 'holding me in mind' to make this contact with the GP. Could you perhaps send a copy of the letter if you have one by post to the GP with a note asking for an appointment, if asking in person or on the phone is difficult? You deserve help and acknowledgment that you are struggling, your need is legitimate, your GP should and most likely will understand that breaks in therapy can be a risky and difficult time. Mine did (even if not fully), and wanted to help, and it was somewhat helpful to have someone to touch base with in my therapist's absence, even though it wasn't in any way a replacement therapy session. I still felt alone without my regular therapy sessions, but it helped a little. And it is still a part of your therapist's care for you that they have put this contingency in place.I'm glad you've touched base with the forum where people who care can also offer support and advice. This shows you are acknowledging your own needs, and that you deserve to be heard, and that you want to make it through this difficult time and out the other side. And you will, even though it's painful and so lonely.Sending warm thoughts to you Wave, I am willing you on. Big hugs x""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.675513,0.532425,0.0,0.886952

I'm sure you haven't lost her support over this though, I think in the overall scheme of things it won't be looming large in her mind in relation to you. If you didn't get what you wanted out of the appointment, could you go back again? Do you have a copy of the letter your therapist sent? (Sadly I'm not suprised at her not mentioning it, in my experience they tend to be led by what you raise, rather than raising things themselves, and that's if their systems have worked correctly and they've even got/read the letter enough, to realise it's important). Maybe if you just wave the letter in the doctor's face and let her respond to it, maybe it would start a discussion about the help you need right now.

I don\'t subscribe to the idea that there is anything or anyone out there that will give us meaning. The Universe does not care about us, any more than a cardboard box might.My little sister just died on June 30, and my little brother is going to die later this year, thanks to Hepatitis B and C. Mom joked that my inheritance just tripled, but we\'re really working to deal with this.I\'ve had my bouts, where I wonder about the point, or why bother when it\'s all meaningless. I\'ve rambled about it all before, so I\'ll try to refrain.The meaning of life is the meaning that you apply to it. If you want to make a difference, then you can volunteer. Go study a field where you might be able to improve the lives of others.If it\'s truly meaningless to you, then at least do something for yourself. Take a shower. Play video games. Write something on the forum. Basically, I just described my morning.As for the ""point"" of life, I think that the point of life is like the point of a needle. It\'s very small and focused, and it matters only to you. Your happiness, sadness, pain, joy, excitement... all of it is yours. You are the star of your own movie, just as everyone else is theirs. You may have no idea how many times you were a background player in someone else\'s story, but it could be into the millions.Maybe nobody cares about you, or very few might. That\'s nothing special. We give no thought to the 50,000 babies who die every single day from diarrhea due to unclean drinking water. And I\'m sure they don\'t think about us one bit, either. None of you knows me, so the likelihood of you caring in a way that would impact me would be most small.I figure that I\'m in a pretty good place, relatively speaking. Sure, I could do myself in and be done with it. But the time that I have here is so relatively short. I\'m not suffering from End Stage Renal Failure or a cancer of any kind. The time is short, and maybe pointless, so why not do something for me?Certainly, you deserve that for you. F**k the world, and any concept of meaning! YOU are here RIGHT NOW, and you can do something for you. Let go of what you believe SHOULD be, accept what is, and then you are free to move about and experience something.At the very least, Waverunner, you owe yourself some decent experiences. You owe yourself some help. You\'re harming yourself because the physical pain distracts you from the emotional pain. It\'s also why people drink too much, eat too much, do lots of drugs, binge-watch television, and so on.I have a painful past, so I understand. Maybe not as bad, but it\'s not a contest. My little sister is dead, and my little brother is dying, because they were running from the pain. Instead of running or trying to cover it up, I decided to soak in it. I recognize that the times I was harmed are gone, as are the people who caused the harm, even if they didn\'t know their neglect counted as harm.I refuse to give those past events and people more power by allowing them to f**k up my day today.So I\'m going to do my best to rise above and do something for myself. Some days it\'s easy. Other days, it\'s damned near impossible, and I might binge-sleep all day. It happens, although more rarely than in the past. Those who say, ""It gets better,"" are liars. IT never gets better. YOU get better at dealing with IT.And sometimes we need some professional help to guide us outside of ourselves so that we can effective deal with IT and then put IT in its proper place.When people tell me to ""cheer up,"" I often feel compelled to punch them in the face. I don\'t, of course. But that sentiment never works. Getting help works. Talking about it works. Coping with it works.Self-harm, booze, drugs, and other things are only band-aid solutions that fall off the first time they get wet.I hope that you can find it within yourself to at least seek out some external help in the form of a professional, because like everyone else, YOU deserve a decent day.I might live another 20 years, or I might live another 20 minutes.

1082,AliceinWonderland,"b""Sounds like you're having a deep think about things Wave. I wish it wasn't painful for you, but it sounds like it is. What can you do with the anger? Any ways you know of to safely defuse it or work it through? Write down what is making you angry and then tear the paper into little pieces and throw it away?Try not to be too critical of yourself with regard to the insight about yourself if you can. I guess insight is usually a good thing in the long run, although it can be painful to face up to things we hadn't realised about ourselves (I hope I'm not barking up the wrong tree or being insensitive in saying that). Remember depression magnifies the things we think are wrong with ourselves, which may not even be an accurate assessment in the first place, so it can be hard to keep things in perspective, and to have a sense of proportion about things. I read something the other day which said 'Every so often I need someone to remind me I'm not as awful as I think I am'. I relate to that, maybe you too? You're a very kind, caring, wise, insightful, supportive and strong person Wave. You might not often feel that you are, but your friends and people who know you have seen evidence of it, even when you perhaps can't see it. Take care, hope your weekend has some bright moments, and any self-critical thoughts don't weigh on your mind too much. x""",0.667013,0.0,0.562663,0.594969,0.86381,0.0,0.955729

1091,AliceinWonderland,"b""That's difficult if you don't feel you can be around people. Is that because you feel you would show the rage you're feeling? Are there perhaps people who understand why you're feeling this way and wouldn't be phased by it, and would understand that rage is sometimes an understandable reaction? Please try not to internalise it though, I hope you don't do anything that's harmful to yourself, emotionally or physically. You aren't the true target of the rage I don't think, if the rage is about something that happened that was outside your control. Perhaps there is no one or nothing that is the true target of your rage, and that is difficult, because if there's no one to rage at then it's easy to take it out on ourselves instead (in fact it's easy to do that even when there is someone who deserves the rage to be directed at them, somehow it's easier to keep it inside rather than pin your colours to the mast and admit you feel rage towards another person, I know this from personal experience).If you don't feel up to being around people, is there anyone you could chat to in real time via Messenger or something, or by phone if you're ok with phone calls? I'm just thinking of things that might distract you. Or keep posting your thoughts here. Is there anything that's helped in the past when you've felt rage? Art? Making a splattery picture to express the emotions? Writing? You can always destroy what you've written afterwards. A vigorous walk to use up some energy, or other exercise? Or a distracting film/book/music/hobby/cooking?Please don't turn it on yourself though, you don't deserve that. You don't deserve to be hurt more than you already are (even if you feel like you deserve to suffer, I don't think you do  ).Take care Wave """,0.573588,0.0,0.0,0.551573,0.685507,0.0,0.965648
