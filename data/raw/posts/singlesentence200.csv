A new one in the chillout cafe and another in experiences.The aim of the chill out cafe has always been for some time out from mental health struggles and a bit of light hearted ""banter"" so is therefore not the right place to express mental health struggles/ emotional distress. Everyone needs and deserves support so if you don't want to start your own thread or just need a short vent then this thread can be that place.",

2014-10-24 23:33:00,Gajolene,"Wish you would stop, I did that in my first days and regret it now, because in looking back I can see how far I've come, even though it can be hugely triggering for me and I've come a looong way toward recovery. Also friends want to find you and depend on your support as much as you depend on ours. Your better giving yourself forum breaks a few days at a time when things are getting bad and the forum is more triggering than helping. We are real people and we worry when names disappear, especially people we care about as much as we care about you Ghostchild",
