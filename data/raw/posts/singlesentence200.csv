A new one in the chillout cafe and another in experiences.  The aim of the chill out cafe has always been for some time out from mental health struggles and a bit of light hearted ""banter"" so is therefore not the right place to express mental health struggles/ emotional distress. Everyone needs and deserves support so if you don\'t want to start your own thread or just need a short vent then this thread can be that place. '",
