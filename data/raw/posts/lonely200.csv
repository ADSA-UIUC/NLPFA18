That's why I like forums, they make me feel less lonely and just the kindness of having someone reply with empathy and encouragement is enough to make me feel a little better. Are you lonely because you're alone? Or do you feel lonely even when you're around others? I have social anxiety and depression which means meeting people is difficult, and I find that I don't 'play well with others' as my parents like to say. What's making you feel so lonely?   x """,

You are probably so down at the moment that you don't even realise when someone likes you or are showing an interest/checking you out! I know it can suck being single, especially if all your friends have someone, but take solace in the fact that I've been single for five years! Not even a date...  Also, if you are single then you can take advantage of that time to do things that you want to do without the responsibility of having another to worry about. A year isn't a long time at all if you think about it, because looking for a person that is right for you is more important than being with someone to not be alone, and i'm sure once you have found a person like that, you wont regret holding out for more! x """,
