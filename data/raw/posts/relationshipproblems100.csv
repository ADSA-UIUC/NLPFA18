How can i work on the things that make me appear selfish, or maybe I\xc2\x92m wrong for thinking I\xc2\x92m not? And with a stressful job what can help me handle my anger? I try the usual activities but it just gets bottled up. '",
99,2018-10-13 03:43:00,Wavering,"b' I\xc2\x92ve been through a lot of emotional problems in my life, and the issues have never really been resolved and some of my personal problems as a result ended my previous relationship (my first marriage) because she couldn\xc2\x92t stay with me long enough to help me resolve my own issues and I don\xc2\x92t want the same thing to happen with my fianc\xc3\xa9 . Early life (before middle school) was rough, parents got divorced around kindergarten and always seemed to fight when dad would get his visitations, mom was always at work to provide for me and my brother and just wasn\xc2\x92t there for us otherwise (it\xc2\x92s hard to have a life), and then my first stepdad was more interested in me and my brother sexually. As a result from all of that combining until I graduated high school, I seem to have developed an anger problem in my adult life and until a few months ago had a pretty bad addiction to pornography. My fianc\xc3\xa9) and I have always had little fights along our relationship but here lately it\xc2\x92s just been one big constant argument and stress from both of us starting or about to start new jobs isn\xc2\x92t helping at all. She is under the belief (can\xc2\x92t say I don\xc2\x92t make it hard) that some of my actions regarding budgeting or the uncertainty of our new one as selfish. I\xc2\x92ll be the first to say that I can be selfish with my time around work, being on my phone more than I should. I love her, I\xc2\x92m more than willing to do whatever it takes to help this relationship but she doesn\xc2\x92t even notice that I\xc2\x92m trying. I\xc2\x92m not the best communicator and something always ends up coming out wrong (usually leads to an argument) and I don\xc2\x92t want that, and she barely communicates what her wants and needs are unless it\xc2\x92s an argument, which doesn\xc2\x92t help. Is there even anything I can do to show her I\xc2\x92m trying, it seems too far gone lately and I\xc2\x92m worried. How can i work on the things that make me appear selfish, or maybe I\xc2\x92m wrong for thinking I\xc2\x92m not? And with a stressful job what can help me handle my anger?
