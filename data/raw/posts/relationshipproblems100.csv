Early life (before middle school) was rough, parents got divorced around kindergarten and always seemed to fight when dad would get his visitations, mom was always at work to provide for me and my brother and just wasnt there for us otherwise (its hard to have a life), and then my first stepdad was more interested in me and my brother sexually. As a result from all of that combining until I graduated high school, I seem to have developed an anger problem in my adult life and until a few months ago had a pretty bad addiction to pornography. My fiancé) and I have always had little fights along our relationship but here lately its just been one big constant argument and stress from both of us starting or about to start new jobs isnt helping at all. She is under the belief (cant say I dont make it hard) that some of my actions regarding budgeting or the uncertainty of our new one as selfish. Ill be the first to say that I can be selfish with my time around work, being on my phone more than I should. I love her, Im more than willing to do whatever it takes to help this relationship but she doesnt even notice that Im trying. Im not the best communicator and something always ends up coming out wrong (usually leads to an argument) and I dont want that, and she barely communicates what her wants and needs are unless its an argument, which doesnt help. Is there even anything I can do to show her Im trying, it seems too far gone lately and Im worried. How can i work on the things that make me appear selfish, or maybe Im wrong for thinking Im not? And with a stressful job what can help me handle my anger? I try the usual activities but it just gets bottled up.",
