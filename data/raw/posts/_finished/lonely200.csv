2012-05-25 22:01:00,bulbie,...all of the time. It's crippling me. (Nod 2),
2012-05-25 22:08:00,manekineko,"Hi bulbie, I share your pain! That's why I like forums, they make me feel less lonely and just the kindness of having someone reply with empathy and encouragement is enough to make me feel a little better. Are you lonely because you're alone? Or do you feel lonely even when you're around others? I have social anxiety and depression which means meeting people is difficult, and I find that I don't 'play well with others' as my parents like to say. What's making you feel so lonely? x",

2012-05-25 22:40:00,bulbie,"I'm completely isolated here, that really doesn't help. Been single for over a year whn everyone seems to have someone. No one wants me. (Crying)",
2012-05-25 22:46:00,Unloved,hiya Bulbie.. You are NOT alone in your feelings.. I Know how hard it can feel.. Admitting you feel alone is half the battle (i think).. Keep talking you can get through this x,
2012-05-25 22:51:00,manekineko,"You can talk to your friends here (Smile) AWWWWWWW, I'm sure that's not true! You are probably so down at the moment that you don't even realise when someone likes you or are showing an interest/checking you out! I know it can suck being single, especially if all your friends have someone, but take solace in the fact that I've been single for five years! Not even a date... Also, if you are single then you can take advantage of that time to do things that you want to do without the responsibility of having another to worry about. A year isn't a long time at all if you think about it, because looking for a person that is right for you is more important than being with someone to not be alone, and i'm sure once you have found a person like that, you wont regret holding out for more! x",
2012-05-25 22:55:00,Allyke,Love you Bulbie (Group Hug) xx,
2012-05-25 23:25:00,Sugarplum,You sound fantastic to me. I'd go out with you if I wasn't taken(Frown)SPXx,Allyke
2012-05-26 11:24:00,bulbie,"Thank you so much everyone.I'm hoping a visit home might pick me up, but right now its hard to see that. I've gotten a little flabby too and all that makes me think is who would want me with a body like this? (Frown)",
2012-05-26 11:52:00,Unloved,"morning Bulbie, its nice to hear your going out visiting.. Being able to go bk to your 'roots' can be reassuring.. On your body image,, anyone worth their salt would see past that straight off!,.. judging someone on looks alone is pretty shallow, buts thats how i see it.. Really hope you get out there, and end up having a Cracking day! X",
2012-05-26 12:05:00,Foxjo,"Morning Bulbie, ive just logged on. all the people above have given you great words of wisdom. its true, people find each other, fall in love with each other in more ways than just the physical sense. friends too, cannot always be around but on-line there is always someone to talk to. thats why i love the forum. there is always someone 'here'. try and enjoy some of the sunshine this weekend, log on later and let us know how you are?hugs Fox",
2012-05-26 13:48:00,bulbie,So I'm out at McDonalds then going to get the shopping. I feel like everyone is looking at me thinking I look a mess.,
2012-05-26 13:56:00,blacktulip,You could never look a mess (Hug) xx,
2012-05-26 14:19:00,bulbie,"I feel like I do, feel like my hairs a mess and I look ridiculous in this outfit, and that everyone can see my tummy. (Sorry)",
2012-05-26 14:30:00,jaxie40,"Fox is right, I met and fell in love wih my second husband when I was least expecting to. In fact, I was anti-marriage, vowed I'd never do it again after the first. Anyway, I got to know a lot about my husband through many late night chats. I fell deeply in love with that person, not what he looks like. If you saw him in the evenings and weekends, you'd mistake him for a layabout, dressed in torn old jeans and tatty t-shirts. That side of him really doesn't bother me, he's comforatble dressed like that, and that's what's important.And I bet you don't look a mess at all! Seeing some of the sights around, I bet you have nothing to worry about, Bulbie(Hug)","Foxjo, bulbie"
2012-05-26 20:16:00,bulbie,"Thanks Jaxie. I just wish I could meet someone who values me enough, who loves me enough to want to marry me.(cry2)",
2012-05-26 20:22:00,Foxjo,"Hi Bulbiei met my husband through on-line dating, i fell in love with him over the internet. talking to him, getting to know him first then meeting up with him, i too was painfully shy at meeting people so i felt for me it was a great way of getting to know someone first before dating them in person. obivously there are some men/women on there only out for one thing and they get it. but you can usually suss that one out pretty quickly!today i went out in the sun, i too have put on a lot of weight with my change in meds, i felt like a white whale out in the sun. but i know thats just me and how im thinking about myself right now. i tried not to let it spoil my dayout but it is hard. yeah i wish i was a size ten with beautiful hair and teeth but it aint gonna happen! acceptance is what is needed- acceptance from ourselves. then once we feel beautiful to ourselves we can portray that to others.",
2012-05-26 20:28:00,bulbie,"God my teeth are another issue. I'm very scared of the dentist, and am scheduled for oral surgery but its months off... I've met so many people who judge if you have less than perfect teeth even if the rest of you could be deemed perfect.I've been told i'm ugly all my life, so naturally I believe it so strongly now.",

2012-05-26 20:37:00,jaxie40,"Aww how awful Bulbie. My dad used to tell me that I was ugly and that no-one would ever want me. I grew up believing him. MY self estemm is still low, though with thanks to psychotherapy, it's better than it was.Anyone who judges on appearance is shallow, and doesn't deserve to be in a decent relationship.

It can get a little lonely from time to time.But I have faith that I'll meet the girl of my dreams somewhere. Maybe I already have. And there's plenty of opportunities out there. Why, just today I was offered by an ad on this very forum inviting me to engage in dating gay women. Which unfortunately wouldn't work seeing as how I'm a hetero guy. Oh well, better luck next time. (Unsure)But I'm sure you'll find that special someone sooner or later. Keep the faith. (Hug)I'm finding a lot of the comments in this thread to be very encouraging and supportive.

2012-05-26 23:38:00,-Phoenix-,Hehe... I'm Welsh but my mother is English and I was born in England. So I'm a bit of both. I consider myself more Welsh than English though. I've lived most of my life in Wales and I do have a Welsh accent. (Smile),bulbie

I would fit in with middle class/professional people if I had the money as I have the same interests/want to spend free time in the same way but can't get there. It's driven me to drink. I hope you can find a way out of it. I'm assuming for you it's about being out of work. Work and education are the main ways to meet people (church would be another good option depending)...

2012-05-28 12:42:00,Wiseowl,Hi bulbie just wanted to say I started gardening to help my mental health about two years ago. I started growing fruit and veg in pots on the patio at first. I tried to be a green gardener no pesticides this website is very good for that http://www.greengardener.co.uk/ It really does keep you fit and it helps you get out in the sun (when we have it) so you get lots of serotonin.

2012-05-28 12:52:00,bulbie,"Thanks muchly for the link, it's going to come in really useful! T's mum is a horticulturalist, but I'm always too shy to ask her stuff. (Embarrassed)",

What I actually do is ask her if she'd like to come to Tesco's with me when I go (she doesn't drive), and sometimes text to see if she'd like to come round for a cuppa. And that's controlling!

2012-05-29 18:28:00,bulbie,It sounds like you haven't got a good husband. That's not what I am looking for. It's just as ok to be lonely and single as it is to be lonely and in a relationship.,

It would be easy for me to say ""Don't feel bad because you weren't there"", but it won't stop you feeling that way. The fact that you're going to see him soon will be appreciated by him, I bet (Smile)As for your ex....... t****r is one word of many that springs to mind!

2012-05-30 12:00:00,Starless,"Hey WiseowlI went through hell trying to steal this mini stargate, and a matching one for B. As you can imagine, the team of SG-1 is rather possessive of said alien technology. I did manage to steal them both, but it also involved the use of a shrink ray I've unfortunately never been able to retreive. Security's tighter these days. (Frown)",
2012-05-30 12:06:00,bulbie,Help! Amanda is Tapping into mine!,
2012-05-30 12:08:00,Starless,"It's alright, just hit whatever appears with a spatula. They'll assume the world is too hostile and never bother coming back.",
2012-05-30 12:09:00,Wiseowl,People are so untrusting these days. Not like the good old days. It almost makes me reconsider my career as an evil criminal mastermind (signing on at times has been tricky the job centre staff do look puzzled)Now please excuse me while I feed my pet sharks in my evil lair moohaha! (Grin),
2012-05-30 12:11:00,Wiseowl,Two things you should always carry with you a towel and a trusty spatula (Smile),

Chat to us we're your friends (it's okay if you want to run now) (Grin)I had some thread responses yesterday that really got me angry but I decided to let it lie it's a waste of energy and there are other people who really appreciate people replying (whatever their viewpoint).,
