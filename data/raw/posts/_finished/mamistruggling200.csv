2018-08-27 22:06:00,mami5,Have been really struggling with suicidal thoughts all day. Can't get them out of my head. Don't want to live anymore. (cry2),
2018-08-27 22:16:00,Mayflower7,"Hi Mami,I'm sorry your struggling and feeling suicidal, I know you don't trust your CPN or cmht.Think you had problems with the Samaritans as well.A/E is too far away. I'm here to listen and care.I'm not surprised your feeling low, you've been thru such a lot.Can you book to see your GP, not sure how long you have to wait. Hope I'm right that you trust her more.I'm sure your trying to distract yourself.Hope you feel better soon.Keep safe Mami and don't make any rash decisions.We care here about you (Hug)Take care",
2018-08-27 22:57:00,mami5,Thank you Mayflower (Hug)Seeing my GP in near impossible......or any when it comes to that! I don't trust her anymore anyway.....she works with CMHT.....and I really don't trust them.My head is telling me I really want and need to die. I can't see a way out of this.,
2018-08-27 23:08:00,Mayflower7,"Hi Mami,Sorry about your GP, don't listen to your thoughts. Please believe me.You don't need to die, I've been suicidal before.It does pass, it is distressing I know.Here to listen.Take care",

2018-08-28 01:03:00,Aurelius,"""I keep imagining me dead and what would happen in life without me there."" - On the day one of your children look for you (and at least one of them will), you will not be there. My friend's sons, from time to time, still look for him - but all that there is for them, is what is left of him in other people.My mentor used to constantly remind me that 'you can lose the will to live - which may be about reaching the depths of despair, hopelessness, exhaustion and depression - but that that should not be confused with making a conscious decision to die by taking your own life'. Mami, please walk away from ending your life and leaving the world an emptier place - especially for those you love. You have already had so much taken away from you - if you are not there - what you have lost can never return.",mami5
2018-08-28 01:05:00,JohnDoe-mk42,"Hey Mami, I don't know you and you don't know me, like at all, but I've recently had two friends go through similar emotions and a year or two ago I felt the same way, fortunately I held on through those dark times long enough to regain the will to live, my friends on the other hand didn't. I wasn't particularly close to them and I regret that as I couldn't give them the support they needed. So I would request that you do two things for me, 1) please try your very best to just fight through this, one day it'll get better 2)reach out to someone, anyone you know for support don't let someone else make the mistake I made best wishes to you for the future and all the wonderful things that will come.",
2018-08-28 02:45:00,SelfRespect,"I wish I could offer better support. I took an overdose when things got too much I thought everyone would be better if I wasn't there. I was found unconscious in the toilet downstairs, I awoke in hospital a couple of days later to realise what my family had gone through. I still struggle with thoughts but it is those you leave behind who will continue in the struggle. Now I think I'm lecturing, sorry.I try to take every minute at a time, getting through in small steps, not trying to think too far into the future, just trying to keep on swimming so to speak.Neither of us know each others problems but I try to think, although a real struggle at times, that there are those that do not have my advantages such as NHS and my family, I don't mean brothers and sisters but husband and children in my case, clean water and a good sanitary system, just those little things I'm fortunate to have, sorry I bet loads of people have said that to you, and having thought that I've still self harmed.I should tell myself to shut up (Smile) Stay strong (Smile)AG",

2018-08-28 13:08:00,LoveYourself,"I`ve been having similar thoughts a lot the last months. I feel so unstable and unsafe with myself because i just simply cant control my thoughts sometimes. But dont give up, keep doing your utmost and improvement can and most probably will occur sooner or later. I keep reminding myself this. Please dont give up before you`ve tried everything.",
2018-08-28 21:52:00,mami5,Thank you all (Group Hug)I'm sorry that so many of you have been affected by this.I also knew people who are no longer here because of this dreadful illness. I've tried to keep busy and distracted today......but the thoughts are never far away.Thing is....I now believe them. I no longer want to fight it......as I really believe I want to die.I know my kids will miss me and grieve......but I'm convinced this won't last and then they'll realise that they are better off without me.The urges to do something.....I shouldn't......are strong ......and still gaining strength.I can't see the point in carrying on. (cry2),
2018-08-28 21:56:00,Waverunner,You are stronger than the urges Mami. You have fought through excruciatingly difficult times and come through. You can do this!! Sending you hugs!,

2018-08-28 22:44:00,mami5,All my life I've been fighting.....what for?At least before I'd have more better days.....and even some 'highs'. But they've faded away and are very very rare these days.....with no 'highs' at all.They say that things should get better with age......but that's not true......I'm getting worse......I know I am......and there's nothing anyone can do (cry2),
2018-08-28 22:47:00,Mayflower7,"Hi Mami,Your feeling very low, everything will seem bleak. Please don't give up.I know you've had to fight all your life, it isn't fair I know.Please keep talking if it helps.Take care",mami5
2018-08-28 22:51:00,Aurelius,"We never feel better off when we lose someone we love, especially if they take their own life. Very soon we come to feel that we failed them - a feeling that never goes away. Feeling responsible for what we have done/have not done never leaves us - responsiblity is not like guilt, it cannot be absolved.At the moment your thoughts are strong and getting stronger, because I think (I might be wrong in this) that you are losing or maybe have lost contact with the love/feelings of love inside. Otherwise the thought of forever losing your children and your children forever losing you would not be so easily swayed. I know this from your earlier posts - which showed just how hard you have fought for your right to be their mother - your right to share in their lives - and their right to share in yours.I do not know if it is possible to reach this superhuman strength of love that you have shown before. But please, please try to - only this time do it for yourself.Mami you have a right to love yourself. Do not give into your thoughts. On this occasion let love be stronger than death.",mami5
2018-08-28 23:08:00,mami5,I don't love myself......don't think I ever have.I hate me.....so much.I crave the love of others........but don't feel it.My parents never said that they loved me.......my 2 ex husbands did......and they abused me.......all in the name of love.I have no idea what if feels like to be loved......really loved......and probably never will.It breaks my heart.Don't blame others though. After all who would want to love me......when I can't even love myself. (cry2),
2018-08-28 23:27:00,Aurelius,"Some of us have to learn to love ourselves and it is really hard as there are no guides to follow. Can you remember how your children looked at you when they were really, really young? Those moments when their eyes looked into yours - and you were the only person in their world and something inside you melted and smiled. I think that feeling is love.I cannot remember my parents looking at me that way, or feeling love from them. But I remember my grandmother giving me that look and doing things that made me melt and smile inside. I rediscovered this memory through my children, when they were barely beginning their lives. I am desperately hoping, there are memories from the earliest times in your children's lives that will do the same for you Mami.",mami5
2018-08-28 23:42:00,mami5,"I don't remember much about the days when my children were young.....any of them. I suffered a lot with depression back then too.I hate my past.I don't have many good memories from it......and those I have are tarred......as my ex destroyed everything that was remotely good in my life.When my 3 youngest were little......it is all one long blur......of abuse, anger.....and tears.I was very suicidal then as well.Wish I'd done it right at the beginning.......spared all this pain.....and heartache.I know it means that neither my kids nor grandkids would have been born.....but maybe that would have been for the best.",
2018-08-29 00:15:00,Aurelius,That is terribly sad - it sounds like my childhood - but not my time as a parent. Have you had much contact with your grandchildren?,mami5
2018-08-29 08:27:00,AliceinWonderland,"Sadly I don't think they would (realise that). Because your brain isn't being truthful with you. When you're depressed your mind tells you lies. Like 'people would be better off without me, I'm such a burden to them, and such a cause of misery and worry, they'd be relieved not to have to put up with me any longer. They might be sad for a while or pretend to be more upset than they are, but deep down they'd be glad it's all over'. I've had these thoughts too, and a large part of me has truly believed them. Both before and since I've had children. But it's our minds deceiving us. It's not true at all. Everything I've read about the aftermath of suicide describes families and friends who  never stop feeling the effects . Who always wonder 'what else could I have done? Was it my fault they no longer wanted to live, am I in some way to blame? Why didn't I do x or say y? Why didn't I realise how much pain they were in, how much they were suffering? Why didn't I know that they really would go through with it?' I'm sorry if this comes across as blunt, but it's what really happens after suicide, in my own experience (I lost someone I loved through suicide), and in all I've read or heard about. And I think it's especially so for children of people who die by suicide. It doesn't matter what age they are, even if they're adult. They  always  wonder  what if ? What if there was something I could have done? What if I'd been there, what if I could have stopped them? What if I'd let them know how much they meant to me, and how much I needed and loved them? What if I'd have said the right words, or given the right support? What if I hadn't upset them so much? What if I'd been less trouble? What if I'm in some way responsible, what if I was part of the problem? What if, what if, what if?It's very hard not to feel guilty after someone you know or love ends their life by suicide. It's very hard not to feel you could have done more. I don't say any of this to make you feel bad, or make you feel guilty for coming to this conclusion that you truly want to die. I've been there, I've truly believed the same, and I already felt guilty enough, and enough of a failure at life, I didn't need people guilting me further. But if you really believe that it would be better for you to no longer be here, then sometimes one of the few things you can try to hold on to is how it would affect your family, and others who know, like or love you. Your mind will be telling you lies about how no one would be that upset, no one would care, everyone would heave a sigh of relief, or be secretly pleased. But they're  lies , convincing ones, but lies. They're not true. It's not how it really would be. People would be devastated. And they'd  always  remember you and miss you, especially your children. The pain wouldn't be forgotten, or eventually diminish. They wouldn't one day be able to carry on as if you'd never been in their lives. They just wouldn't. I've had to tell myself this when I've felt there was no option other than suicide. I've had to hold on to that when there wasn't much else to keep me here. When my mind has been trying to convince me that everyone would be  better off  without me here, I had to cling on to that small quiet niggling thought 'what if they're not?'.I'm sorry if I've gone on. I really hope there'll come a day when you can say 'I'm glad I decided to tough it out, I'm glad I found it in me to keep on keeping on'. I believe that day can come for you. It's so hard when there seems no one to reach out to (professionals I mean), and I'm sorry you've had bad experiences and been let down, but you  are  reaching out  here . And then again, what have you got to lose reaching out to professionals, you already feel as low as a person can feel? You might get some small help, you might find something useful. Even if nothing comes of asking for help, you have shown yourself that you can ask (as does posting here). And that signifies that some small part of you knows you deserve help, and would like help. And it shows some small grain of belief that help  could... just might,  make some small difference. Enough to keep you going another minute, another hour, another day. And that's all that's needed, to just take each minute, hour, day at a time, to get you through, until it gets less painful, which I believe it can, it has before (even though it might feel like it never will, again it's your depression's lies telling you that).Keep on with the distracting. I think that's a really good thing to do, as much as you can manage to.I'll stop now I've said enough, probably too much. I'm sorry if it's a bit much to read. I'll just leave a link here, an article that's helped me, in case you feel up to reading it at some point  13 Lies Your Depression Is Telling You Many hugs to you Mami (Hug) (Hug) (Hug 2) (Hug 2) xx You are not alone x","mami5, mami5"
2018-08-29 14:53:00,Aurelius,"Mami have you tried your new meds yet? - You said in an earlier post ""She's put me on Aripiprazole instead of Risperidone"" May be she did this because Aripiprazole has a low-to-very low incidence of causing weight gain (Risperidone has a moderate incidence) and it is can work well as an anti-depressant (but not in all cases).However, Aripiprazole has been linked in some cases with suicidal thoughts (mainly in children, adolescents and young adults). Where this happens, the advice is to contact the GP asap. Mami, if you are taking Aripiprazole please do this urgently!!",mami5
2018-08-29 21:51:00,mami5,Thank you Aurelius and Alice (Hug)I haven't taken the meds.....don't trust them......don't think I should be on them considering the warnings on them.I did manage to reach out for help today. I called the drop-in centre and had a good chat with a staff member who has been supporting me a lot lately. I'm suppose to call her again tomorrow.I'm still really struggling with these very dark thoughts......but trying to cling on to the fact it is my son's birthday tomorrow. He will be 21........and is keeping me alive.....for now.,
2018-08-29 22:16:00,Mayflower7,"Hi Mami,Glad you have some help from the drop-in, happy birthday for your son, hope he has a very special day.Sorry your still getting intrusive thoughts, we're always here to listen.Take care",

You see you do bring wonderful gifts into the world and moments of joy and wonder to us here on the forum.",mami5
2018-08-29 23:04:00,mami5,Thank you Mayflower and Aurelius (Hug)I had to give my word to drop-in staff that I would keep safe and phone her tomorrow.....otherwise she would have phoned CMHT and ask them to come out. I don't want that.......don't trust them.Urges to do something are strong though.......struggling to focus on tomorrow. (cry2),
2018-08-29 23:37:00,Aurelius,"Mami, I wish I could do the struggling for you and take the urges away. But all I can do is send you hugs and my hopes that some of the care we feel for you will somehow reach you and help you meet the challenges you are facing tonight.",mami5
2018-08-30 21:33:00,mami5,"Thank you Aurelius, you are very kind (Hug)I wouldn't wish my pain on anyone.I phoned drop-in this morning.....and spoke to the same staff member. She wanted me to go in and see her tomorrow afternoon to discuss things in person......I've agreed to go after taking son home.Then this afternoon I had an appointment with a nurse....to be weighed. I go every 2 weeks. She could see I wasn't right. We talked.....and I told her everything. How I feel.....suicidal thoughts.....not eating....the works. She insisted I see a doc.....wouldn't allow me to go until I had. Receptionist phoned CMHT though and I had to wait for duty to call back.....and talk to him. I know him, his son was in school with my son. He's going to get my cc to call me tomorrow and arrange to meet asap. After the call, a doc came to the room.....for a chat. By then I was quite distressed and desperate to go home. I had been there for about an hour and a half.....and just wanted to go. Thankfully she was happy for me to go.I never wanted to cause such fuss and bother to everyone. (cry2)",
2018-08-30 22:18:00,Aurelius,"Mami is once again ""Mami the brave"". You should be so proud of yourself for the way you keep struggling to move forward - despite eveything that tries to drag you down (from your invasive thoughts, to your depressed feelings, to some pretty rancid people who seem determined to cause you hurt and pain).It does not sound like you caused 'fuss and bother to everyone'. It sounds like everyone you met today wanted to support and help you - and make sure that you were going to be okay health wise - and you let them. So, I think they will have all felt pretty good and appreciative about the time they spent with you. It sounds like it from the positive follow-up actions they took....I hope the cc call tomorrow is as positive. You deserve that for being so brave!!",mami5

2018-08-30 22:44:00,mami5,Thank you again Aurelius (Hug)I don't feel brave. The staff at the doc surgery just took over and wouldn't let me leave. I had no choice but to do as they said. It was all quite stressful and I really wanted to go home.Am not looking forward to cc's call tomorrow. I don't trust them....and am scared of them.Now my anxiety is playing up too....on top of everything else. Can't take it anymore (cry2),
2018-08-30 23:03:00,mami5,Thank you too Mayflower (Hug)We'll see what tomorrow brings.I'm scared of telling them exactly how I feel in case they take action.,

2018-08-31 21:41:00,mami5,CC never called.So much about duty telling me he would make sure he'd call and arrange an appointment asap. Even the surgery receptionist said she was going to phone CMHT to make sure he had called.But he didn't.I went to drop-in to see the staff as arranged......after taking my son home. I told her what had happened yesterday. She phoned cc.....and I talked to him. He knew about yesterday.....he asked me about it. Told me he was sending me a letter.....second post.....inviting me to phone him to arrange an appointment. So much about him phoning me to arrange one asap!!He has given me some hand-outs before....and expect them to solve everything!Really don't think he has a bloody clue. (cry2),
2018-08-31 22:23:00,Aurelius,"Well it sounds like everyone did their bit aprt from the CC. He could only have known about yesterday because they had called him. I have lost count of how many times everything has collapsed, gone nowhere or got completely out of hand due to an incompetent and/or negligent CC. It sounds like that is what has happened here? I just hope they do not all try covering up for him, as seems to happen too often. But 'Mami the brave', you once again have tried to move things forward despite all of this. Next time you are feeling that you are useless or not worthy, just remember how competent you are - far more competent than CC the 'professional'!!!",mami5
2018-08-31 22:38:00,mami5,Thank you Aurelius (Hug)What's the point of reaching out when at your lowest and desperate only to be told to read hand-outs.....call out of hours or go to A&E over the weekend........for them to probably keep me in psych ward 'for my own safety'!He has arranged an appointment for next Thursday morning.......so we can 'discuss things' then. He's in no hurry to see me...that's obvious.Drop-in staff said she'll come with me. She also told me to either go in or phone her when they open again on Tuesday. At least she cares. She has been very good to me these last few days. I definitely prefer her to cc.,
2018-08-31 22:48:00,Mayflower7,"Hi Mami,Lots of us have had bad experiences with the CMHT, however when your a risk to yourself and others A/E sometimes can help by getting you the on-duty team.Yes I know they might section you, sometimes it's the only way of keeping you safe.I know CMHT is far from perfect, it's all we have at the moment.Very glad your getting support from drop-in, she sounds lovely.Handouts probably aren't that helpful, some nurses just don't know how to help us.Maybe it's lack of experience, or competence.I hope you get more support and the suicidal thoughts/urges stop soon.Take care",
2018-09-01 23:21:00,mami5,"Thank you Mayflower (Hug)The staff at drop-in is fab, she's only young....in her 20s.....but just 'gets it'. She understands where I'm coming from....whereas CMHT don't. Plus she genuinely cares.....and not just completing a tick box exercise.Got cc's letter today. He wrote it on Thursday....before the surgery phoned CMHT. What he conveniently forgot to mention on the phone yesterday was the fact he's off on holiday....again!! This will be the 4th I think since April. He was off for 2 weeks at Easter, had 1 week in May, 3 in June and now 2 weeks from the 10th. I've never knows anyone to have so many holidays!!! His letter also says I can phone him to arrange an appointment if I wanted to see him before he goes. This goes against what he previously told me and wrote to me. He originally told me he had arranged an appointment for me for the 24th....and would put in writing....it never came. I was then thinking maybe he had changed to yesterday.....obviously not!! Even when the duty officer had told him what happened on Thursday......he had absolutely no intention of contacting me!!If I hadn't contacted drop-in for support....and she called him yesterday.....that letter could have sent me over the edge!!How am I suppose to trust someone like that? The fact that I did not contact him at all when at my very lowest this week speaks volumes where I'm concerned.I'm glad he's off for 2 weeks......at least I'll get some peace and feel safer without him around.",

2018-09-02 20:34:00,Aurelius,I wonder if they train CCs this way - probably not. Is it in ther job description or person specification - probably not. Are there just too many people who seem to behave this way and get away with it - definitely.Reminds me that parents always used to say the same thing - 'it is not about what qualifications people have - we want people who are competent and really care'.

I honestly don't see the point in seeing him on Thursday.....unless I can pluck up the courage to really tell him how I really feel about him and CMHT as a whole. He knew I had trust issues when I first saw him back in May, and although he tried to help put my mind at rest for the first couple of sessions or so....he has since managed to not only not trust him....but also have no faith in him. Having contact with him completely stresses me out....it shouldn't.I don't think him and me are meant to be.I would ask for another cc.....but I've lost trust and faith in the whole team. I don't know what to do. (cry2)",
2018-09-02 22:06:00,Mayflower7,"Hi Mami,I'm not surprised you've lost trust in your CMHT, you maybe could ask for a different CPN.I hope drop-in are able to support you.Wish life was easier for you.Take care",
2018-09-02 22:14:00,Aurelius,"The situation with your CC is not good news. Here is a suggestion - you can throw it out - alter it - or whatever. But it puts the onus on him to address the issues that have created the current situation - so you do not have to engage in a long emotional presentation. Write the trust issues as a chronological list - i.e., appointment/letter failings, etc (you have some details in your posts here that you could use). At the start of the appointment tell him there are some serious trust issues that have led to a loss of trust in him - and your trust in the CMHT as a whole. Tell him that you have carefully listed the issues and that you would like him to read the list and respond to the points raised. His response should tell you whether you want to give him a further chance or whether you need to tell him 'that you do not feel that you can work with him and you feel you need a fresh start with a new CC'.On the other hand, compiling your list might result in you already knowing that you cannot continue to work with this CC. You can then use the list of issues in a request to the CMHT for a fresh start with a new CC.",mami5
2018-09-02 22:47:00,mami5,"Thank you Mayflower and Aurelius for your responses. (Hug)The staff at drop-in has suggested, more than once already, that maybe I'd be better off with a female cc. I'm not sure if that would make much difference though....but maybe worth considering.Current cc spends his time, during my appointments with him, writing everything I say in his little book....yet still manages to get things wrong. My care plan...which took ages to complete because he was forever on holiday....is covered with my corrections. He had so many things wrong....and I don't know how....that the whole thing looks a mess.....and as a perfectionist, I find it really annoying!He also writes a 'to do list' for himself which really raises my hope that he understands and wants to help....yet when I see him in 2 weeks time....he openly admits he's done none of it....and puts it down on another 'to do list'. No excuse, explanation or anything. Just nothing. It's like he doesn't care or is bothered at all that he hasn't done anything. I did mention this to drop-in staff a few weeks ago and she phoned him to offer to do it for him......don't think he appreciated it and miraculously by the next day he had managed to do it all! Doesn't help me have trust nor faith in him though.Plus while he's writing everything down.....it is very hard to actually engage with him. There's no eye contact or anything and feels very impersonal. Guess I wouldn't mind so much if what he wrote was right and was doing it for my own good....but it's not.....and I'm fed up of correcting him all the time. I dread to think what he's writing in my actual notes!!Staff at drop-in once told me he was a 'good one' though....but the problem is....what he says and what he does are completely different things.",
2018-09-03 00:19:00,Aurelius,"Good grief Mami - there must be a production line. Your description of your CC, word for word, mirrors the shortcomings of one of the most inadequate CCs I have come across (who was not one of my own, but was the CC for a young female with acute needs, who I was working with). The CC was inadequate because he never conversed directly with the young person, in terms of things she wanted to talk about. Instead, he asked questions based on his poorly recorded, innaccurate notes from the previous meeting. We only received a draft copy of the previous meeting's notes at the start of the next meeting. He always tried to dodge issues around actions that he had failed to follow through, by blaming others, although the truth invariably came out at the CPA reviews. As there was no accurate recording of the content of appointments (despite reams of note taking) and no carrying out of agreed actions = no coordination of care = care plans that were never implemented = no care = constant risk instead of support.In the end, there was no option but to change the CC. The young person asked for a CPA review, where the change was agreed. She also asked for a female CC, as she felt this would enable her to approach a range of issues that she was uncomfortable addressing with males - even the most sympathetic males would not be able to fully understand and would be unable to empathise with her personal issues and feelings as a young woman.When she spoke about her new CC (female), it was in much the same manner as you speak about the young female member of staff. Whoever you have, it is most important that they 'get it' and that they 'get you'. Your current CC clearly does not on either count!!",mami5
2018-09-04 21:46:00,mami5,Thank you Aurelius (Hug)Sorry you've come across a similar cc to mine and glad she got a more competent and understanding one afterwards.I went to drop-in this morning for a chat. Told her what I thought of my cc and that I had been thinking a lot about last week's events over the weekend. I then told her I had decided I wanted a new cc......she agreed it might be for the best. Thing is.....if I can't phone him when in crisis.....and we both agreed I was last week....nor he be bothered to phone me after two separate requests to do so.....then something's seriously wrong and things would never work between us. We both also agreed I'd probably be better off with a female.....I also requested a Welsh speaker and someone who knows and understands BPD. She was going to phone cc and inform him...plus cancel my appointment for Thursday. Problem is he's been in meeting all day and I'm not sure if she got hold of him.....if not.....I have no doubt that she'll continue to try again tomorrow. I'm planning on returning to drop-in tomorrow anyway.....am going to go back to the craft group as I haven't been for 2 weeks now. It will be nice to see the gang again.While I was driving out of town on my way home afterwards I felt like a great weight had been lifted off my shoulders.....and I knew instantly that I had done the right thing. (Smile),
2018-09-04 22:06:00,Aurelius,That is really great Mami!! Hopefully this is the start of all your bravery being rewarded. Big hugs to Mami the Brave!!,mami5
2018-09-04 22:15:00,mami5,Thank you Aurelius (Hug)Have to admit I am feeling a lot better and more optimistic about my future now.I don't think it possible for me to have a worse cc.......is it? I hope I have someone similar to staff at drop-in....but doubt it somehow as she's one in a million.,
2018-09-04 22:33:00,Mayflower7,"Hi Mami,Hope you get a great CPN, mine was terrible too.You have done the right thing.Glad your feeling a bit better.Take care",
2018-09-05 22:35:00,mami5,"Thank you Mayflower (Hug)Drop-in staff finally got hold of cc this afternoon.....and told him I wanted someone new......preferably female. He said I need to write a letter to his manager, to make it official....he's going to put it in writing for me. Staff told me to take the letter to her when it comes.....and she'll sort it all out for me (Smile) She's an absolute godsend. I hope the letter comes before the weekend.....I don't fancy having to sit on it until Tuesday.Tomorrow's appointment has been cancelled too......which means I don't have to see him again (Smile)Apparently he was ok about me dumping him.....he was probably pleased to get rid of me. (Whistle)",

2018-09-07 23:49:00,mami5,"Am not well (Low)My anxiety has been bad for months.....and it is getting worse.I am so tense and jump at the slightest noise. It has now reached the stage that I find watching television very difficult. Any raised voices, slightest violence, anger or sudden noise just affect me so badly. It is ruining my life.Tonight....it is worse still. I keep having to check around the room in case someone is there.....watching me....or wanting to harm me.",
2018-09-08 01:04:00,Aurelius,"Mami, that level of anxiety is awful. When my son (adult) gets this anxious and no one else is at home or he thinks they are probably sleeping, he retreats to his bedroom and barricades the doors (bedroom door and built in wardrobe door). This way he feels safe. I do not know if doing something like this would work for you? At other times he sits in one corner of the room (i.e., the living room), so he can see the whole room all of the time. The tv is angled so he can do this.",mami5
2018-09-08 23:46:00,mami5,I'm sorry your son is badly affected too Aurelius (Hug)Anxiety is a terrible thing.....especially when this bad.I think in my case that recent events regarding my ex husband.......plus the thoughts of having to face psychologist soon.....have triggered my PTSD......making things worse.I struggle to keep it all under control when with my sons despite the fact I feel it bubbling up inside of me. Then once alone.....it just ruptures.I am so tense my body hurts......and I'm so tired from being constantly alert. I also have tingling in my hands and my heart rate is through the roof.I can't continue like this (cry2),
2018-09-09 20:57:00,Aurelius,"Mami, do you have any meds for this and/or access to any anxiety focused therapy?",mami5
2018-09-09 23:18:00,mami5,"No, I'm not on any meds.....nor receiving any therapy.I haven't actually seen anyone from CMHT for nearly a month and don't know when I will now I'm requesting a new cc.The only support I get is from staff at drop-in and she's always in demand and therefore not always available. She also takes people to appointments etc., like she came with me to see my cc, so isn't always there. I hope I get to see her tomorrow to sort me a letter for a new cc, she said she would.",Aurelius
2018-09-10 00:35:00,Aurelius,Maybe you can talk to your new CC about the anxiety and the impact it has been/still is having on your well being and life - and see if she can suggest/access something to help you through these daily struggles. It could also be a starting point for her getting to know you?,mami5
2018-09-10 22:04:00,mami5,Thank you Aurelius (Hug)Managed to get an appointment with a GP this morning regarding something else....and while I was there I asked for something for my anxiety. After a bit of a chat she eventually gave me Duloxetine to try. She's only given me 7 as wants me to return to see her again next week.......said she wanted to keep an eye on how I get on with them. So far.....not so good. Despite taking it with food.....my stomach is really dodgy. I'm in a lot of pain and have been sick. Hope things settle down soon. Have just taken an Omeprazole to try.,
2018-09-11 00:51:00,Aurelius,"Mami, I hope the side effects do not persist. I know it can sometimes take quite awhile to feel any positive benefits, but I am crossing my fingers in hope that the Duloxetine starts to have a beneficial effect on your anxiety as the week goes on.",mami5
2018-09-11 21:53:00,mami5,"Thank you again Aurelius (Hug)Like most meds, unfortunately it will take weeks before I see any really changes to my anxiety.The GP yesterday only gave me 7 tablets.....enough to last a week.....and told me to see her again for more. I asked the receptionist for another appointment in a week's time.......and only just noticed.....she's made one for Wednesday! What am I suppose to do regarding my meds? I can't just stop them for 2 days.....can I? This a mess and I don't need more stress. (Crying)Went to drop-in this morning to try and sort out a letter regarding my request for a new cc.....but the staff I see was unavailable.....she had a first aid course today. Will try again tomorrow.....but it will be busier there tomorrow and therefore harder to get to see her.",
2018-09-11 22:11:00,Mayflower7,"Hi Mami,Sorry you are having side effects, hope the omeprazole helps. I'm not good with meds either.Hoping you get to see the staff member you know at drop-in.You don't need extra stress, the receptionist should have booked you in for 6-7 days time.Here for you.Take care",
2018-09-11 23:01:00,Aurelius,"Mami, you do need to get a new appointment because you cannot stop them for 2 days - also, depending on how you have responded (i.e., side effects wise) your GP may wish to step up the dose (this is quite normal). The timescale for people reporting an improvement in their symptoms ranges from one week to a month after they start on the medication.Do not get stressed about making a new appointment - just point out that it is essential as you can have significant side effects if you suddenly stop taking the Duloxetine and you have no problem with them double checking this with your GP. Normally that is enough to move things forward.I hope you get to see your CC tomorrow!!",mami5
2018-09-12 22:58:00,mami5,"Lucky for me my GP receptionist phoned first thing this morning to change the time of my appointment. I explained to her that I needed to change it to Monday, and gave my reasons why. She said that Mondays was for emergencies only and I'd have to phone on the day to make an appointment as she was unable to do one for me. I persisted with my reasons, and all of a sudden.....she miraculously managed to book me in! So I now have an appointment for Monday morning instead of Wednesday......and better still......it is with my usual GP (Smile)Saw staff member at drop-in today too. She's written a letter for me now to request a new cc. She told me to ask for proof of postage.....and I did.Guess it is a matter of sit and wait now.",
2018-09-12 23:22:00,Aurelius,"Once again you have been 'Mami the brave' and kept on with the struggle where many others (even those in much better health) would have given up. Everything seems to be moving forward in the right direction and it is all down to your courage, persistence and bravery. This evening you should feel incredibly proud of yourself Mami. I feel incredibly proud to know you here on the forum.",mami5
2018-09-13 22:16:00,mami5,Thank you Aurelius....you are very kind (Hug)I don't feel very proud or brave.....I didn't do anything really. It was the receptionist who called me regarding my GP appointment and it was the staff at drop-in who wrote me a letter for a new cc. Few months ago I would have done it all in my stride......but the smallest of things stress me out these days.Went to see the nurse this afternoon.....to get weighed......I go every 2 weeks. I've managed to lose more again and she was very pleased with my progress. She asked me if I was going to continue and I said yes. I've lost quite a bit in the last 4 weeks. What she doesn't know however is that I'm practically starving myself to do it. I'll go through most days eating nothing but a very low calorie meal at tea time. My stomach is in constant pain......always reminding me that I'm doing well.....and it will be worth it when I go on the scales.Something inside me tells me that what I'm doing is wrong......but I can't stop. I know if I start eating again the weight will pile back on......and it will all be in vain. I can't do that.I feel nauseous...don't know if it's down to starving myself....or side effects of new meds.....or both.,
2018-09-14 00:58:00,Aurelius,Sorry Mami but you are still 'Mami the Brave' - because none of those things would have happened without you making them happen - and it is really challenging to ask people we barely know to do things for us that until recently we were able to do for ourselves!!Good luck with the 'starvation' diet - but promise me you will eat a little more if you start to get weak or feel really ill.,mami5
2018-09-14 22:27:00,mami5,Thank you Aurelius (Hug)I don't feel well on this diet. My stomach really hurts from when I wake up until I sleep again and I feel so nauseous I find it a struggle to eat anything. I'm also quite lethargic and just want to sleep all day. I had to force myself to eat something at tea time so I could take my meds.....it really hurts.,
2018-09-17 23:09:00,mami5,My stomach pain seems to be getting worse......especially after I've eaten......though that's not much. (Low),
2018-09-17 23:29:00,Aurelius,"Mami, stomach pain is one of the side-effects you are advised to check immediately with your doctor. As yours is getting worse - perhaps you should give them a call tomorrow?",mami5
2018-09-18 23:08:00,mami5,I can't see a mention of stomach pain as a side effect of Duloxetine except for liver problems....and I don't think I have that.I saw the GP on Monday but did not mention my stomach pains to her......I was scared she would tell me to eat more......and I can't. I'm seeing her again in 2 weeks time......I will tell her then if it's not any better.I spent this morning in bed and have been taking regular painkillers to try and ease the pain.,
2018-09-18 23:56:00,Aurelius,"Mami, here is a web link to a US site you might find useful. The link should take you directly to the side effects page for Duloxetine -  Duloxetine Side Effects in Detail - Drugs.com I have attached a pdf copy of the information, so you can have it to hand if that helps.I hope you feel much better very, very soon!!",
2018-09-19 23:19:00,mami5,Thank you for that Aurelius (Hug)I went to my GP's surgery this morning to try and get an appointment but was told they were full.I have now stopped taking Duloxetine as the pain was getting too much and bringing me down making my depression worse.,
2018-09-20 00:26:00,Aurelius,"Mami, if possible, try to diary any daily changes in your symptoms from when you stopped taking Duloxetine (especially in terms of stomach pain, nausea, appetite and depression). It may help your doctor identify a more appropriate course of treatment (i.e., in terms of avoiding the side effects that you have been experiencing). Sadly, wherever you look in the world, it seems that it is becoming increasingly difficult to access a doctor's appointment in primary care - let alone in more specialist services. I hope you can get an appointment very, very soon!!",mami5
2018-09-21 22:58:00,mami5,"Thank you Aurelius (Hug)I finally got to see my GP today.....my usual one. I had to declare myself as an emergency to get to see her......and I was really.I told her everything. Stopping Duloxetine due to stomach pains, starving myself, I didn't want to live.....everything. She said I was to complex for her to treat and phoned CMHT. They told her that they would phone me in 10 minutes.....they eventually did about 3 hours later.GP told me I was in crisis and needed extra help. She's also changed my prescriptions to weeklies and told me I would be impulsive for ever. (cry2)",
2018-09-22 00:00:00,Aurelius,"Mami, I am glad that you finally managed to see your usual GP and you clearly were an 'emergency'. You were very brave, but also very wise, to tell her everything. She was right to tell you about her professional practice limitations and to contact the CMHT. Now nobody responsible for your health and mental health care can claim that they have been kept in the dark or are unaware of the challenges you are facing.Regarding her comment about being 'impulsive forever', impulsivity is part of my ADHD diagnosis. My last therapist always reminded me that:'You are no longer an impulsive child. Your 'impulsivity' as a mature adult means you are always likely to take action whenever you think it is necessary. The world may not like that, but that is not your problem. Your problem will be the time you fail to take action when, all things considered, you knew you should have.'Best of luck with the CMHT - they may be more responsive now they know your GP is 'in the loop' and the referral is from her.",mami5
2018-09-22 23:25:00,mami5,"Thank you Aurelius (Hug)My impulsivity is down to my BPD and GP was responding to the fact that I had told her that I sometimes disassociate and o/d on impulse. Having her say that I'd be like that for ever has hit me quite hard because it means I'll never get better and will stay like this forever. So what's the point in anything? Doing DBT or any therapy?I feel I'm a drain on NHS time and resources.CMHT weren't much help yesterday either. Whoever my GP talked to was English, the woman who called me 3 hours later...was Welsh....not same person. She asked the usual question of what had happened to make me feel so low yesterday then gave me the spiel of who to contact over the weekend. She offered to contact my last cc...I declined, she then told me to go to drop in on Tuesday if I needed more support. At no point did she offer me to phone them again!Feel like I'm being passed from one to another and nobody really wants to know or help or take responsibility for my care.....except for the young staff member at drop-in....who is not really qualified to do it! I don't like to burden her with my problems all the time. (cry2)",
2018-09-23 00:26:00,Aurelius,"Mami, if your impulsivity is part of your BPD then it will probably be lifelong, in the same way as it is if it is part of one's ADHD. This does not mean that it will always be a disabling component - it only impairs us when it acts as a driver to do risky things that might be harmful. Nobody seems interested in talking about impulsivity when it acts as a driver to do risky things that might help others - that is called bravery, courage, etc (i.e., like the case of those people, who acting on impulse, run towards what everyone else is 'standing back/running away from' to help someone - despite there being a potential risk of harm to themselves).The point of therapy where impulsivity is concerned is to get enough insight and self-management to be able to control the different emotional and psychological drivers involved in a more effective way.Drain on the NHS time and resources? - You would probably not even think to ask this if the question was about someone with a physically observable health condition, even if their prognosis was far worse - i.e., such as in cystic fibrosis. I think you would also be angered if anyone suggested that someone with a condition like cystic fibrosis should not receive treatment and therapy on the basis that it is incurable.Mental health services are already treated as 'cinderella services' in the NHS - and as patients with mental health conditions we are often treated as 'second or third class' citizens. This is also true for many mental health professionals. Let's not view and treat ourselves this way - because if we do, how will things ever change for our children if the have similar problems to us?I am sure that if your problems become a burden, she will tell you. You will just have to keep reminding yourself that 'you are not your problems' - so, that if at anytime she tells you that 'she cannot deal with your problems' you do not take it as rejection of you as a person.",mami5
2018-09-24 00:21:00,mami5,Thank you Aurelius (Hug)When my GP phoned CMHT on Friday she asked them to see me that day. Where she's concerned I am now receiving the necessary support off them.But I'm not.I was told however that getting a new cc can take a while. Thing is the criteria to be accepted into CMHT has changed so much since I first entered nearly 30 years ago! These days they only take on very serious cases....and with no magic quick fixes on offer.....clients tend to stay longer. With caseloads already full it will take some time before someone takes me on.Where someone with cystic fibrosis is concerned.....the care and support they receive does alleviate their symptoms and is therefore value for money. Sadly for me though....I seem to be getting worse with age. And it's not just me saying this as some family members have also noticed it. Despite all the input I've received over the years off CMHT.....I'm not getting any better.....instead the exact opposite is happening.I'm tired of it all.Offered therapy....given hope....trying everything......only to be told I'm worse than what I was before I started......which wasn't well at all.Now they expect me to start over and try again......same therapy......what's the point?,
2018-09-24 01:12:00,Aurelius,"Mami, sadly what you say about getting a new CC or being accepted into CMHT is entirely true.I purposely chose cystic fibrosis as an example, because the symptoms often cannot be alleviated as the condition progresses and worsens. A major reason for continuing to offer care and support, is that it offers hope - hope that this will enable moments where life feels precious and worthwhile, despite the chronic physical, emotional and psychological distress. I do not know whether it is possible to judge that in 'value for money' terms. I do know that therapy and therapeutic support in mental health can come down to offering hope for much the same reasons as mentioned above. I, also, know that when we lose hope nothing seems worthwhile and our worlds become quite desolate places - where 'life' increasingly becomes 'existence'. Mami, it seems from your posts that when you spend time with the member of staff at the drop-in centre it enables you to have moments where your life almost feels precious and worthwhile again. For that reason, I think this is the best therapy/therapeutic support you are receiving at present and I hope you will continue to make the most of it (at least while you wait for other things to happen/not happen).",mami5
2018-09-24 23:38:00,mami5,"Thank you once again Aurelius (Hug)I have an appointment with the drop-in staff for Wednesday afternoon. She's going to help me prepare for my meeting with psychologist etc. regarding my complaint against him. She'll also take me to the meeting next week and support me there, together with my NHS complaint advocate.Receptionist at GP surgery phoned this afternoon wanting to change my appointment for next Tuesday from morning to afternoon. I told her I wanted to cancel it really (since I originally made it to get more Duloxetine...which I've now stopped), but she told me not to cancel because the doc wanted to see me. I'm now left wondering what she wants.....unless she hasn't realised I've stopped them. (Scratch Head)I'm not well today. I've had a bad case of the runs since noon. It is really bad. Have no idea what my stomach is still spewing out but the pain of it is beyond. I really hope it clears by tomorrow. (Low)",

2018-09-25 23:43:00,Aurelius,"Did your GP check you for a possible kidney infection - related to your recent dieting - i.e., have you been drinking plenty of fluids? If not, maybe you should get this checked out....",mami5
2018-09-26 23:23:00,mami5,My GP didn't take any notice when I told her I wasn't eating.....but I am drinking though.Pains have subsided today....am back to just the stomach ache now.Have an appointment with the nurse tomorrow afternoon to get weighed. I go every 2 weeks. I expect to find I've lost quite a bit. Went to drop-in today. Saw the staff member who has been helping me lately. She went through everything regarding psychologist with me and we made a list of questions to ask him next week. She's going to type them up for me by then. It was her birthday on Monday. She was 24. The 5 of us who were there had a whip round and bought her a card and gift. She was touched.Not well tonight. Feel really low and suicidal again. Hate feeling like this all the time. Sick and tired of it. I need to end it. Wish I had years ago. Don't want to regret it in years to come too.,
2018-09-26 23:43:00,Aurelius,"Mami, I know you are feeling totally down and want to quit existing like this - but it would be a really hellish 24th birthday present for the staff member and one she would never forget. If there is life after death, being the person you are, you would regret the lifelong impact on the staff member who has been helping you - and no one would be able to take the pain away from either of you. Please do not do this to yourself.",mami5
2018-09-27 23:20:00,mami5,"Went to drop-in again today. Don't usually go on Thursdays. I asked the staff member if I could see her....she said in 5 minutes. Over an hour later I went looking for her again.....she had gone out. About half an hour later the other 2 who were with me decided to leave and go home. I didn't like sitting there on my own....so I left too.I later phoned CMHT and talked to whoever was on duty. Told her I needed help or I wouldn't be alive for much longer. She's going to chase up my request for a new cc, and if one has been allocated then she's going to ask her to contact me to arrange a meeting asap. She's also referring me to psychiatrist again. Got the impression she's keen to get me on meds as I'm not on any for my MHI at the moment. She also told me I can phone back if I need to.I hate bouncing from one crisis to another like this. (Crying)I saw the nurse this afternoon too. I've lost more weight.....as expected. She was pleased......until I told her I was starving myself to do it. She wanted me to eat regular meals and fruit etc, told me my bowels would be affected otherwise.....I told her they already were.Tonight I'm fighting strong urges to self harm and relentless cravings to comfort eat. Desperate to give in to both. (Crying)",
2018-09-30 23:20:00,mami5,"Stress levels are getting worse.Have today totally given in to my urges to comfort eat and have binged most of the day. (Crying)Difference is....I know the cause this time.It is all down to my meeting with psychologist next Wednesday morning. I haven't seen him since our last session just over a year ago.....but what he did and said that day still haunt and affect me. I hope this meeting will help resolve some issues regarding my complaint against him and will then allow me to put it behind me and move on. I'll never forget though.....and trusting someone enough to allow myself to open up about things again in therapy is going to be very, very hard.I haven't been sleeping well lately and it seems to be less every night. As result I feel so tired during the day I have been unable to do any of my coursework today as planned. If I try to read my textbook my eyes just sting and close. It is not going to happen!Feel like giving up. Life is just one hurdle after another without giving me a chance to recover in between. What's the point? Why do I do it?",
2018-10-01 21:17:00,Aurelius,"Mami please stop being so hard on yourself - you are already being treated far too hard by life and your medical issues. Okay, you had a binge session on comfort food - far better than self-harm or contemplating suicide!! You need to indulge (or even over-indulge) once in awhile in something pleasurable - sometimes it is the only positive boost there is on what often feels like a tortuous journey towards an empty horizon.You are also due an alternative to always going to bed for your own safety!!Your upcoming appointment more than explains why you should not realistically expect yourself to:- sleep well - feel other than anxious and fatigued in the day - not have a range of gastrointestinal symptoms- not have stinging (probably very tired and strained) eyes- not be able to focus or concentrate on your OU reading and coursework (or anything else that is mentally demanding) - what you are going through is worse than a bad bout of flu - and you would not expect yourself to do any of these things if that was what you were suffering from!!I do hope that next Wednesday's appointment does allow you to start to draw a line under your previous experience with the psych - so you can begin to gather enough trust and confidence to slowly test the waters again - even if this is just in terms of finding someone you feel might be able to work with...",mami5
2018-10-01 23:31:00,mami5,Thank you Aurelius (Hug)I phoned student support today to ask whether it was possible to get the textbooks in a larger print. I explained my eye problems to them to give them reasons for my request. Had an email back this afternoon. Basically they tell me the books are available online and it is possible to enlarge the print there. Problem is....I like to highlight things in the book as I go along and this would be very difficult to do if I'm working online! I feel so disadvantaged between everything. (Crying)Got a letter to arrange an appointment for an endoscopy today. Was rather surprised and shocked to get one for next Monday......I was expecting end of the month or even next month. This will be my third visit to the hospital in as many weeks! Needless to say I'm completely dreading the appointment. Guess the sleepless nights are destined to continue. (Crying)Still eating junk. I bought so much of it yesterday.....and again today. I go to some shops specifically to buy junk....I can't stop it. Hate myself for it though.I really need something good to happen in my life.....and something to look forward to would be nice instead of dreading everything.,
2018-10-02 11:47:00,Aurelius,"Can you download the books as pdfs? If so, you could highlight them using your Adobe Reader. Otherwise, you could try printing them - but use the pdf option when it asks you which printer you would like to use.I guess the good thing about the closeness of your endoscopy appointment, is that it means you will not have to endure a prolonged period of anxiety where this is concerned?I hope today is a much better day and is a lot kinder to you!!",mami5
2018-10-02 22:09:00,mami5,"Thank you once again Aurelius (Hug)Unfortunately I won't be able to print the textbooks - there's 3 of them, which is just too much. I'll just have to cope somehow I guess.Popped in to drop-in today to make final arrangements for tomorrow. She printed out the list of questions we compiled last week that I want to ask psychologist in our meeting tomorrow. She's driving me there. I'm absolutely dreading it and my anxiety is getting worse and worse by the hour. I'm also finding the fact that the meeting will be held at the psych unit quite scary and intimidating. Although I've never been admitted there I have had the police take me there, totally against my will, to be assessed. It was a horrible experience and I don't wish to return there. So glad I won't be going alone.Saw GP this afternoon too. The one who had given me Duloxetine. We basically just sat and talked....or I did. She didn't want to start me on any new meds....so I'm still on none where my mental health is concerned. She did say though that I could go back if I felt I needed someone to talk to. That is something CMHT should be providing....not GP!Feel so depressed and unmotivated that I can't do anything.....yet my anxiety won't allow me to stay still (Crying)",
2018-10-02 22:22:00,Aurelius,"I am glad to hear that you will have transport and company tomorrow and that your GP has offered to be there for you if you feel the need to talk. I know it is not the same as someone from the CMHT, but at least the two people who are offering support are doing so genuinely (and not because it is their professional duty). It says a lot about them and about you. I would hold onto this, especially as tomorrow's appointment is with the psychologist who left you feeling less than positive last time.",mami5

2018-10-09 21:16:00,mami5,In a bad way.Was in town this morning.....ended up at drop-in as didn't feel safe enough to go home.Had been shopping and kept holding something I shouldn't buy....and managed not to.....just because I knew I had some at home anyway.So I ended up at drop-in. Staff member I see had popped out......I waited for her return. She came back to find me sitting there......staring at a packet (of something) I had in my hand with a glass of water on the table in front. She told me she wouldn't take them off me but would wait for me to give them to her instead. We talked. At the end of the session she asked me for them......I thought about......and reluctantly handed them over. She was pleased. Told me she'd keep them in the office safe until I was better. Have tried to distract myself since by doing my college work etc. but urges are still there. Not too convinced I'll resist for much longer. (Crying),
2018-10-09 22:00:00,Aurelius,"Mami, sad to hear the urges are strong again. Glad you met up with your staff member and had the strength to hand the packet over - which must have been really tough, as it was the last thing you probably wanted to do.If you can keep going with the college work, that is a win-win for awhile as it addresses your assignment demands and helps keep the urges in check. Hopefully, you will then feel worn out enough by the stresses of the day to be able to go to bed and keep safe. Big hugs...",mami5

2018-10-10 20:46:00,Aurelius,"Welcome to the forum sotiris. Sorry to hear that you are carrying a quadruple burden of depression, anxiety, anger and despair - especially as they all often seem to feed off each other.Have you expressed your feelings towards her or are you hoping she will guess/not guess how you feel (depending on both of your circumstances)?Sometimes we have to decide between our relationships with our work and our relationships with other people - i.e., which of these is most necessary to our lives. Sometimes we are so driven by forces inside us that we do not have a choice - i.e., our art is our survival. Sometimes life makes the choices for us - i.e., she says yes or no - or circumstances already make approaching her impossible, etc.If you cannot have this relationship you desire and if you live in a world where only your art does not let you down - then maybe you need to retreat there and feed your frustrated feelings of love, depression, anxiety, anger and despair into your works of art - and for awhile let them be your muse (i.e., for as long as it takes for the pain to lessen enough to begin feeling more at ease with yourself and the world outside).",sotiris

2018-10-10 23:31:00,Aurelius,"Mami, you have fought so hard recently - especially for your son and to try to get good mental health care and support. Maybe right now none of this seems to matter compared to the 'urges' and the need to escape all the pain you are constantly faced with in most (if not all) areas of your life - but not having your son lose you forever and not losing your son forever does really matter when I read your posts from over the summer. It is hard for you to keep fighting - maybe it feels impossible - but please try - you and your life are so precious, unique and important. Huge hugs.",mami5

I've contacted my tutor and am waiting her reply. I've arranged an appointment with optician and discussed things with the needs assessment centre.

2018-10-13 15:58:00,Aurelius,"An exhibition is public - so, if you choose to go public, it is you who cannot run away from what you have disclosed to the world - others can choose to not attend or walk away.An exhibition is public - so, if you choose to go public about the sexual abuse, I would strongly suggest that you disclose this to your family prior to 'telling the world' - there will be enough hurt, without you adding to it by seeming to place them second to strangers.An exhibition is public - so, if you choose to go public, you will no longer be anonymous and that can come at a price (both for you and your family) - so, be prepared to weigh the benefits against the costs (not only to yourself but also to those you are close to).",sotiris

With the medication I took for it (which worked!) being stopped, and nothing else on offer.....I've had to take matters into my own hands. Unfortunately though.....at the moment.....doesn't offer me peace.....instead it gives me nightmares. (Crying)Thing is, my PTSD has been triggered....badly. Back in March the manageress of drop-in referred me to RASA.....on Tuesday I was offered an appointment for next Wednesday. Though this is something I need to do....it has brought back so many bad memories. (Crying) I'm also scared of telling her what happened......for her to tell me it wasn't what I've thought it was for all these years. The only person I've told so far is the psychologist I complained against......and although he validated it.....I'm questioning everything he said and did during therapy. Plus this counsellor will be experienced in this field and will therefore know what's what....and what isn't. I don't think I'd be able to cope if she said I was wrong about it and have suffered all these years for nothing. It really scares me. I find it hard to not think about it and the flashbacks are getting worse by the day. (Crying)My tutor emailed me back this afternoon to let me know she's had mine and will reply in full on Monday. She's busy over the weekend and will have time to look through the work for me then. Not looking forward to going to the optician's though. I'm scared of repercussions. I need a report stating my eyes are bad to get the support I need to enable me to continue my degree.....but scared they'll say I'm unfit to drive. Don't know what I'd do without my car......I rely on it daily. (Crying)I am absolutely petrified about what my ex has got planned regarding maintenance. I do my best to avoid thinking about it to be honest as I just can't handle it. Me burying my head in the sand won't make it go away though. (Crying)Where CMHT is concerned......I've decided to have no further contact with them. They've made it quite obvious that they don't want to know. Won't be bothering them again.I feel quite impulsive today.....which doesn't make me very safe. On top of that I have suicidal thoughts and strong urges to do something I shouldn't. (Crying)",
2018-10-14 17:38:00,Aurelius,"Mami, everything that is going on at present in your life (or is due to happen very soon) seems to be out of your control - this is probably why you are currently so vulnerable to:- 'having suicidal thoughts and strong urges to do something you shouldn't'- suffering from such high and chronic levels of anxiety- sinking swiftly into depressed moods- experiencing increased levels of physical, emotional and psychological discomfort from your somatic problems- having increased difficulties with sleep (including, it seems, restful sleep?)You might speak to your GP again about these issues and trying to put a break into part of what now seems to have become a self-perpetuating cycle. At least, if she can help you with the sleep aspect - so you start to regain a healthy sleep pattern - this should help you cope better with the other factors. Your coping ability will be increasingly compromised, if your physical resilience continues to get worn down on a daily basis through fatigue.From what I know of RASA, their approach is not judgmental or based on legalistic definitions/criteria - so please try not to build up too many anxieties around concerns over these issues. Certainly,   do not hesitate to refer at the outset to your psychologist's validation  - especially as it strongly supports the referral and your reasons for attending the appointment - sometimes it is really important to disentangle issues (i.e., a GP with sexist attitudes can still make an accurate diagnosis of a disease that is specific to patients of the other gender).With the optician, try to keep the appointment focused (sorry) on the difficulties with reading and close work and the very detrimental impact this has on your ability to study and your employment choices/opportunities.Where your ex is concerned, you may as well bury your head in the sand at the moment - especially if it makes your daily life feel more comfortable. After all, you will not find out what is happening until you receive some contact - there is nothing else you can do in the meantime (apart from worry and get anxious) - so burying you head in the sand sounds like a better option at present!!Where CMHT is concerned - It sounds like you have enough on your on your plate at the moment - especially with your RASA appointment coming up (you might seek their advice about what to do if you have a crisis - i.e., as a result of issues that may arise directly/indirectly from matters that you visit/revisit).Mami, my heart goes out to you - please stay safe.",mami5

(Crying)There's no point going back to my GP.....she's already made it quite clear that she can't offer me anything.....told me I'm too complex for her and so she phoned CMHT and asked them to see me. They haven't of course.....but she's concerned, they have. The other GP I saw did say I could go back to see her for a 'chat' if I needed/wanted to.....but she won't prescribe me anything either. I have to wait until my psych appointment for that......which is not until next month. A long time to go without sleep or to improvise dangerously.

Told her I wasn't seeking forgiveness because I knew I didn't deserve it.....but she said she had.....and not only that....she had forgotten all about it. She asked me if I was going in tomorrow and I told her I was seeing RASA. She offered to come with me.....I thanked her but declined. Told her this was something I had to do on my own......she said she thought that was very brave of me. I don't feel brave though......exact opposite....I'm absolutely bricking it!!

I agreed to.....and thanked her.Really not looking forward to tomorrow. Already suffering badly with flashbacks.....and I haven't started yet! (Crying) I'm trying to turn things round and look at this in a positive way by reminding myself that I am the one who wanted, and still want, this, have been waiting months for it and it is finally happening. Although it is going to be very difficult and painful.....I need to do this to get better. Just over 3 years ago psychologist picked at the scab, made the wound bleed .....and left it. All he did was cover it in plaster....not sure if it was meant to be a case of out of sight out of mind....but it didn't work. Instead, the wound kept bleeding.....and became infected. Now the time has come to remove that plaster....dig in and clean out that wound. Hopefully this will allow it to heal once and for all. There will be no scab for anyone to pick at again....instead there will be a nice clean scar. What happened....cannot be undone....but a scar is better than a scab....and cannot be opened by picking at it. (Wink)",
