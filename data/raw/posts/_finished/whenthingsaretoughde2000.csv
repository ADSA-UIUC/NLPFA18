A new one in the chillout cafe and another in experiences.The aim of the chill out cafe has always been for some time out from mental health struggles and a bit of light hearted ""banter"" so is therefore not the right place to express mental health struggles/ emotional distress. Everyone needs and deserves support so if you don\'t want to start your own thread or just need a short vent then this thread can be that place.'",,None

I think I don't speak thru a survival mechanism. My mum was ill and started pointing fingers at me saying I was same and really pissed me off so I clouted her and went to prison. My nan stole everything from me and didn't allow me to develop the sense of ownership which is important. My family are sometimes nice but overall abusive. I learned not to meet my own needs coz mum was unwell and I would risk breaking attachment if I asked for my needs to b met so I have neglected myself my whole life and i have only just realised things thanks to cpusage awareness posts one from Gabor mate which I studied all the videos I could find and my thoughts and behaviour patterns made more sense to me. So THANKYOU CPU for your posts they are liberating.
