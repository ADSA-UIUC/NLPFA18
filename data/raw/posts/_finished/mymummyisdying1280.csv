It's understandable that you are not able to help with planning for the funeral. I know going to the funeral seems really scary, as is the thought of completely breaking down. Obviously I don't know what is best for you, but I think being at the funeral is an important part of saying goodbye and being able to grieve together with your family, as hard as it is, can also be helpful. I remember when my cousin was murdered, going to the funeral home for the viewing the day before the funeral--I was terrified, but it was important for me to go because it was part of grasping the reality of his death, and part of saying goodbye.""",Fairy Lucretia,Sad

You may feel overwhelmingly thankful that you were given such a wonderful mum because not many get a good one sadly. You didn't have her for long enough but you were so lucky to have had a good one.

This is something that most people have to deal with at some point in their lives (i.e most people outlive their Mummy).I would hazard a guess that for all these people (if good Mum), that this is the worst and most traumatic event in their lives. Probably losing an infant/child/son or daughter/outliving offspring is only thing close to it. I'm not sure I will cope.It's easy to say, but probably the hardest thing you will ever have to deal with. Please keep going - our Mums want us to do this, that is why they care for us, and look after us. I'm sorry I'm not very good with advice Lu.

So I'll just write it publicly, nothing to lose - if you want to chat more maybe you can send me a message?I've been very suicidal for a while too, and had a recent call with a clairvoyant who immediately told me that my Grandad (passed away 8 years ago) had been and is still with me throughout this difficult time, telling me his name and what he had been doing when I was crying and generally being the depressed mess I am. I was really shocked and cried more when she told me this, but she told me he was always with me, always watching over me and always helping me in small ways as best he could. I told her I wanted to die and go over to the spirit world and escape the pain I feel in life and she told me in no certain terms that he Didn't Want Me There yet, that it wasn't my time and I have things to do in this life and she helped me see that there might be some hope. Hearing that he was always with me doesn't change how much I miss his physical presence but it has gone a long way for me to see clearly that I am never alone and I can always talk to him in my mind and he will hear.I don't know how you feel about that, I don't want to cause you any more confusion or pain in any way shape or form, I just wanted to share my story with the possibility of it giving you a little hope that your mother is with you right now too and always will be until it is your time to join her. I also have prayed to be ill to leave this disastrous world and save myself from severe depression/ anxiety but perhaps we do have a time to go and it's not now, and perhaps we do have things to accomplish by being here... I don't know what this is - for me or for you, but I now have hope.I cannot imagine what you are going through, I cannot feel your pain, all I can do is send you a hug and wish you well and all I know is that my Grandad by my side only wants me to be well and happy and the last thing he wants is for me to hate my life and myself so much that I don't want to be here. I don't know how I get to that well and happy place yet, it's a long road, but maybe some joy might come in at some point. Maybe your mum would be sad to see you so unhappy too, not that that is any reason to want to live because you are clearly in extreme emotional pain, but just as you wished her well and life I am sure she would want the same for her beautiful daughter.

You are a lovely person Lu, and have supported people so much on here - why is it the best people that always have so much anguish and pain?I'm SO very sorry at the loss of your dear mum, she sounds like the best mum in the world. It's plain to see that a lot of her continues in you, you have a wonderful, caring heart and I'm sure she wouldn't want you to end your life....it would be such a waste of such a special person. You have been through so much with your mental health problems and now a bereavement of the most important person in your life. You Lu are carrying on part of her, she would want you to be happy. Give Maddie a tickle on the tummy, do things that will take your mind off your mum, easier said than done, I know. Try to be strong, I'm sure you're doing that already. I know you'll never get over your mum dying, my dad died when I was 23, he was my main parent as a child In time bereavement does improve. I know you can't see it now, but life is precious. This is your chance on this Earth. Try to be strong (extremely difficult I know!). Move on when you are ready. I'm trying to help Lu, it's so difficult when not face-to-face with someone. Sorry if I'm not helping. Just ignore me if you're not ready. I just know that you deserve so much more from your life, you really do and I mean it, you are so kind and lovely. Take careVoyager xxxxxxx""",,Angelic

DO NOT tell anyone where you live and make sure you meet in a crowded place when its daytime and light out - like a caf\xc3\xa9 at lunchtime. Tell him you have a doctors appointment in an hour so you don't have to spend long with him and if you have any feeling that maybe all isn't as it should be with the new fella text or e mail him when you get home that you can't cope with a relationship. Don't be nervous about what he thinks of you - HE is the one on trial to see whether he's good enough for you! I know you're still very raw and hurting after losing your mummy, so it may not be the right time to pursue a relationship.

669,2015-09-29 15:53:00,myownveryone,"b""My cat had fleas a few months back. I couldn't shift them, and my house got infested. What I did was I continued to treat my cat. She'd get a flea tablet, they kill all the fells on the animal in a few hours. They literally just drop off, but some drop off alive and recover. To fix this, and any eggs or larvae in my carpets, I salted my carpets. It kills fleas too. They need 50% humidity to survive. You have to be careful not to let your carpets get damp, because it will take the moisture out of the air. I'd say if your house is quite humid, leave it for 24 hours. I left mine for 2 days. My carpets got a little damp but once I hoovered up all the salt it dried out. It'll clog your hoover a little, but I really worked. I also put warm water on a plate, with a squirt of washing up liquid and a candle in the middle. The warmth and light will attract the fleas, and they'll jump in the water and get dragged down by the washing up liquid. It's a great way to monitor your flea population. If you're worried about a fire hazard, use the LED ones, they'll still get attracted to it. I use hot water in my flea traps. This together worked beautifully. I've seen one in the last 3 weeks, and we were infested. It was bad. Hoovering is another brilliant weapon against fleas, as long as you remember to empty your hoover and put the waste outside. If you use flea tablets and then put on a repellant, it might work better than relying on the spot on to kill the fleas? Just kill the ones on the animal and make it not want to jump on? Luckily, the warmest months are almost over. They don't like the cold much.""",,Crappy
