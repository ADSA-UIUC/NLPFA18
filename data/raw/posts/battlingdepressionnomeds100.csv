2,2011-10-25 22:44:00,calypso,"Hey MarkYou say you change moods in the twinkling of an eye, and I would argue that is very rare in bipolar. Have you been formally diagnosed? I am interested that meds don't work at all. Sometimes this is indicative, not of bipolar, but of borderline personality disorder. You could look this up on the site on here. I am NOT diagnosing you, I cannot do that, of course, but the sudden swinging up and down as you feel is much more common in borderline. There is treatment for borderline, a specific therapy called DBT (not CBT). I know very little about it, but others know a lot. It may be an idea to check with your psychiatrist whether you have borderline, or that maybe they could look again at your symptoms. All of this is just a thought, and meds do not work on people with this disorder. There is hope honey. xx",
3,2011-10-26 06:58:00,madmark,thank you for your reply no i dont have bipolar many years ago i was told i was suffering from cronic depression this was when not alot was known regarding depression in the late 80s but the doctor who i see 2 months ago called it manic depression when i say chancge in minutes its not that 1 minute im happy then the niex sad its mainly just my thoughts i cant control them i always try to think possitive but i could be having a realy good day and suddenly my thoughts take over and twist my head about and make things bad to be honest i have seen so many doctors and psychiatrists over the years i gave up and started to just deal with my battle on my own had a realy bad turn 2 months ago and went to gas myself in my car had it all planed out got the pipe found the place and started to do it but managed to click out of it before it was to late i took this as a warning sign that i was out of control again so went to the doctors again was given more tablets and to be honest all the tablets do to me is make me feel stoned and i then lose my thoughts and feelings which i realy hate my thoughts get even lower and i realy do get low so stop taking them had 2 different types of tablets last month but both had the same affect on me when i tell the doc that he says i have to take them but i cant i get that low and very suicidle i cant lose the few possitive thoughts i cling to to keep me here or else i will end it all i have spent so long in this state i leant 90% control but still go overboard from time to time was ment to have councoling but they havent made me a appointment also told me i can only have 6 hours free then i will have to pay for it what a jokeso i guess i am on my own to deal with it again i do have my wife and family to support me but hate them seeing what it does to me as i push them away when i am bad and shut myself down cant stop it they learnt what happens to me aswell so they do know i cant help it but it hurts me so much to put them through it with me people dont seem to realise it affects all the people around you aswell i do work but some times it is so hard to stay focused all i think now after so long in this battle is that ime now 43yrs old so my life is running away and i getting older so i will pass away soon anyway sounds realy bad but thats what it has done to me just wish i could stop the pain for not only me but my complete family i used to deal with it on my own untill the last epesode 2 months ago then i opened up to my wife and started telling her my thoughts and righting them down on the time to change site letting her read my posts every day so she could see what is happening to me but i got the impression it was all to much for her as she got run down and kept crying so now i stoped and pulled back with telling her things for her own protection but there you go just a part of my life for you to look at i hope you are ok and well and once again thank you so much for taking the time to reply to me here is a link to the month i was on time to change go take a read then you will see more about how it affects my life http://www.facebook.com/#!/topic.php...99&topic=19270,
4,2011-10-26 10:55:00,maxitab,"Hi madmark. Twenty eitght years ago doctors were not very refined in their ability to diagnose, and to be honest, I would agree with mayfair, that this sounds much more like BPD to me than just about anything else. Have you looked at the criteria/symptoms. Many of us who have BPD do not respond to medication, but there are now a few very effective treatment ( not meds) options. If this were me I would go to my GP and ask for a proper assessment with a clinical psychologist and put down the manic depression label, since it is not, IMO true for you. Once you have a better idea of what is going on you will be able to access help. It is out there, why go on suffering?",
5,2011-10-27 06:41:00,madmark,i gave up asking for help 26 yrs ago as doctors were no good then and went and asked for help 3 times last month and no change all they do is give me pills that dont work and make me worse and a number for councoling which i phone spend 30 mins on the phone explaining what happens to me and they say they will contact me with a appointment but dont whats the point it just depresses me more and winds me up so give upcarry on as i am it realy isent nice but it has became my life thank you for replying its great to get a responce its very suportive for me another problem i dident mention is i dont like meeting people i hate going in to shops or crowded places i go all hot and sweat if i have to confront anybody so due to this i realy dont do much i do work but its so hard due to this problem i have what they say became a loner over the years lost most of my friends as i wouldent go out just wanted to be on my own all the time its so hard just to go to the local shop,
6,2011-10-27 10:27:00,maxitab,"HI again mark. I am supposing the isolation is due to anxiety, it sounds like it.First, I do need to ask, do you want things to be different? Because anxiety is a symptom of something that is going on that is not being addressed. Also, are you in the UK because being given a phone number for counselling does not sound like the UK....There is a service called IAPT which your GP can refer you to - is this it? If you are getting no result then you need to insist! Phone again and say you want to speak to the manager of the service and explain that you never get the promised appointment and ask who you can make a complaint with. It is amazing how people respond when you get a little pushy!In addition, there is some good help on line for anxiety, however, it is no good looking at it and thinkint 'that won't work for me' you have to be prepared to suspend your judgement and actually do it. If you want to try it, www.anxietycoach.comGood luck. Don't suffer in silence.",
7,2011-10-27 17:56:00,madmark,yes i am in the uk and the doctor gave me the number to call for a appointment which i did cant remember who it was with as i thrown the card away as they p*ssed me off saying i can only have 6 hrs then will have to pay for it think it was wellbeing service /mind its a joke realy does get me down and i do try my hardest to stay possitive but cant keep there just sink again i do have some good days well what i call good days but also have realy bad days / weeks and yes anxiety you hit the nail on the head its as if ime scared to go places so rather just stay in or go to places i already know i do want change have done for years but when i was younger 25 yrs ago had all sorts of pills and see a shrink for a year realy dident do me any good so was sent on my way as like i say a lost corse so had to learn my self to deal with my problems which i did quite well untoll say the last year were i am starting to lose control again think i got to the stage were i had enougth and realy cant be bothered fighting it now so i do lose my battle from time to time thank you so much for talking to me hope you are fine and well in yourself did you read my 1 months diary on time to change site of how my life goes i feel so useless and realy do think i would be better of gone from the people i love as i only seem to hurt and disapoint them due to my problems it drags everyone around me down realy aint good,
8,2011-10-29 07:56:00,madmark,i am off the rails again as they say nasty things going round and round in my head and in my dreams realy gets me down if i could get much lower keep thinking of going to end it all once and for good sick of my life but love my children so much dont want to hurt them and i know if i end my life it will hurt them so cant win,
9,2011-10-29 09:59:00,maxitab,"Mark, did you look at any of the link I posted?What did you think of the suggestion that this may well be untreated BPD? I don't want to be or appear to be unsympathetic, but if it is BPD then I do feel you need to give the new more modern and aware Mental Health Service a second chance ( because you will be giving yourself a second chance along the way).Just because they failed you in the past is not a reason for staying angry at them. If you always do what you have always done - you will always get what you have always got. Try something new. Get on the website, and go and ask your GP for a proper assessment.",
10,2011-10-29 11:35:00,madmark,yes maxitab have checked out your link thank you it has made me understand sort of and what i did learn which i dident know is that thyroid malfunction can cause this problem like i posted i started to suffer from depression badly in the late 80s but managed to gain control of it up to about a yr ago then started to suffer realy bad again and yes seeked help from gp as i couldent work out what was wrong with me and why i lost control after so long had tests and found thyroid malfunction so i am on treatment for this with regular blood checks but still cant gain control of my depression have seen the doctor 3 times in the last 3 months regarding these problems but just pills that dont work i am fighting it hard myself and when i do get down i do look at possitives in life and talk to people regarding my problems but realy does take a couple of days batteling with myself before i can do this i have to pick myself up to a strong enougth state before i open up to anyone but normaly by that time i have so much going through my head its hard to explain what realy went on its just a jumbled mess in my mind i got the letter today funny enougth regarding 6 hrs of free counselling with iapt team i was refered to them by the wpct wellbeing service as they said my situation was to bad for them to treat me so now got to deside wether i think 6 hrs can sort out 28 yrs of my suffering so how i dont think so and i can not afford £50 per hour after my free session a i found the link well usefull thank you for that and i hope u and all the other members reading this post are all ok thank you,
11,2011-10-29 13:17:00,maxitab,"Hi again. The thing about the IAPT is that though they say 6 hours, they have the ability to extend it or to refer you to a different form of therapy if they think you need it, so though the 6 hours sounds silly, it could be good for what it may lead in to.I know one of the things lots of people do is to say they are OK when they are not so don't pull any punches with the therapist, say how things really are for you.I do hope you can get some ongoing help..........",
12,2011-10-30 07:33:00,madmark,here i go again off the rails a big hard bloke like me reduced to tears i f*cking hate this life cant think straight from hour to hour why was i given this illness what have i ever done to anybody to be served this death sentance hanging over me every day,
13,2011-10-30 07:53:00,amathus,"Hi, the unfortunate thing about anxiety and depression is that it can strike anybody at any time....Try some relaxation for a while, google it and see what suits you best...15 mins will help ground you.See how you feel and think after that....qf.",
14,2011-10-30 14:42:00,madmark,feeling a bit better now just so much doupt in my head regarding life in genral,
15,2011-10-30 15:15:00,maxitab,Remember to keep your thoughts under control - you are in charge not them. Just because you have a thought that does not mean it is necessarily:True.Something you need to act on.A reason for feeling a certain way.Untrue!Any more important then the thought 'oh look its raining'.......,
16,2011-10-30 16:03:00,madmark,will try to get the currage to phone the iapt team tomorrow and book myself a appointment for some counselling and go from there they may do a proper assesment on me as i have never had 1 will post once i contact them thank you for the support all of you,

22,2011-11-06 07:50:00,madmark,well ime still focused on the future but my mind is still wandering to the past from time to time i guess there is no real cure and no way to realy get over and win this illness i still havent heard regarding councoling what a joke,
23,2011-11-08 07:54:00,madmark,i am getting realy sick and fed up with this roundabout of emotions i live in cant keep control of myself and my head is all over the place once again,
24,2011-11-08 08:08:00,dawndeec,I was diagnosed with bipolar but my moods flip in a matter of minutes not weeks or months. Its not like bipolar for them to change at this rate. I'm seeing a new psychiatrist soon for a new diagnosis were thinking its bpd. I also found anti depressents made me worse so I'm now on a atypical anti psychotic called seroquel xr. Which is also used for bpd it hasn't done wonders but its the best meds i have tried,
25,2011-11-08 08:10:00,dawndeec,Also manic depression is the old name for bipolar,
26,2011-11-08 19:13:00,madmark,thanx for reply dawndeec not sure wether i can be bothered with doctors any more they just keep giving me anti depressents that make me worse and dont seem to listern to what i say to them waste of time so far anyway glad to here you getting somewere with your problems,
27,2011-11-08 19:35:00,nomadic,"I have been reading post to your thread, ....I read Maxitab 's post a week ago.....I agree......get properly diagnosed.....you must 'insist' your GP refer you to your local metal health department...proper medication for the proper illness....You have struggled on your own for long enough.....you must 'ALLOW' yourself the help.....As said already in thread....DO NOT SUFFER UNNECESSARILY....mental health have treatments for the symptoms, give them a chance to help you...best wishes",madmark

30,2011-11-09 06:45:00,madmark,what i have noticed just over the last 2 months is i get depressed mixed up nasty things going through my mind and shut myself down not talking to people so a i can deal with the issues in my head as soon as i sort it and get over them i am good for a few days then off i go again with different issues as if the goal posts keep moveing i try so hard to stay focused and involve myself in doing things but just cant seem to stay focused i had bad depression when i was a teenager but won the battle when i was about 25 was ok then all the way to the age of 38 yrs old then it slowly creeped back in to my life with the big bang being 3 months ago were i totaly lost the plot now i cant seem to get back to normal as i call it i am now 43 yrs old it seems as if its alot worse now than it has ever been in my life its as if i have 2 minds mine and the illness fighting me constant battle to keep focused on my life every possitive i think of i get 2 negitives pop up straight away was on the verge of leaving my wife and children the other day to stop there suffering as when i get down they go through it with me and cant get it out of my head that i cant stop my feeling but i can stop there suffering by getting away from them i feel so responcable for making everyone around me feel down it realy does hurt me,
31,2011-11-17 21:56:00,madmark,well i still waiting for this frigging appointment for my assessment doing my head in now just want it over and done to find out what they think,
32,2011-11-19 15:57:00,nomadic,"Hey Madmark, I sometimes wrote things down so I could take it to doctors...just feelings and thoughts...i felt it helped take the pressure off me a bit...the waiting is never easy....",
33,2011-11-19 18:07:00,madmark,yes could be a good idear but the only thing is my list would be as long as my arm as they say my mood and thoughts change by the hour but hey good idear hope you ok and well,
34,2011-11-19 18:24:00,nomadic,"hey you........ am fine....... thanks for asking...write that down.....""my mood and thoughts change by the hour""....keep a note pad with you....jot it down...when the notion takes you....",
35,2011-11-19 18:41:00,TiredTina,"Hi madmark,Living with depression is extremely hard as I know from experience. It is a constant battle which is absolutely exhausting as it takes all your energy to keep up the fight.I picked up on the bit you wrote about thinking of leaving your wife and children. I can see what you mean about your illness affecting them as well but what you have to keep in mind is the affect your leaving would have which Im sure would be considerably worse.I see you are waiting for an appointment and hopefully when that finally happens they will be able to offer you the support you need.I see that this thread is called 'been a battle for 28 years with no medication'. Im sorry I havent had time to read from the beginning so dont know the full story. I dont know whether the no meds situation is because you havent been prescribed them or you choose not to take them. I will try and read your whole story so that I have a better picture.If you havent done so already would you consider starting your own journal on here where you can keep a log of how you are doing?Tina",
36,2011-11-19 19:26:00,nomadic,Hey madmark....I agree with tina.....whilst under the depression......I found it so very difficult to work out my symptoms.....In my case...very poor concentration....very down thoughts all the time.... etc...my illness was untreated for many years....Will someone be going with you to your forth coming appointment.....?Have you the support of your 'family' in your efforts with mental health...?You have support from this forum x,
37,2011-11-19 21:50:00,madmark,thank you both and yes i have had meds and lots of them and was on them only 1 month agao again but they realy dont work just make me lose what little control i do have so i choose not to stay on them and yes before any of you say it i have given it a good go just my mind is so strong after suffering so long it over power the meds and yes 100% agree with you both its a massive battle to keep control and i do go within myself and shut down to protect myself some times for days even weeks with no feeling and no emotions scares me so much but i do regain control and bounce back had a real bad run 2/3 months ago got some bad news and it pushed me right over the edge which is why i asked for help tryed to take my life 2 times but managed to stop myself at the last minute but yes totaly lost myself for around 1 month but yes here i am still fighting but i am running out of energy and my lows are lasting longer and longer and i am slowly giving up as if my batteries are now flat i do have support but feel i need to do it on my own for myself i am 43 and had this illness since i was 16yrs old i dont look faward no more as the future scares me and i defenatly try not to look back this site is great i was on time to change site and done 2 months diary for the doc but they closed the site and it s been deleted such a shame as it was when i was at my lowest thank you all for your support it realy does help me dont know how but it seems to take away some of the suffering just by posting on the site for other peoples views and like i always say to people only people who suffer the illness will understand me so thank you and stay happy and be strong,
38,2011-11-20 19:05:00,madmark,here i go again no emotions no feeling and shut myself down,
39,2011-11-21 20:45:00,madmark,still cant shake this bad feeling within myself scares me why does it keep happening for no real reason ?,
40,2011-11-21 21:32:00,nomadic,Hey madmark....you said you suffer from manic depression...yeah!I think you might be feeling 'bad' due to the symptoms associated with the manic depression....I have been on a variety of medications over the years...I take medication every day.The medication helps to control some of my symptoms....some of the time...not all of the symptoms all of the time......Best wishes,madmark
41,2011-11-22 06:50:00,madmark,hi nomadic i aint on no meds i have got some but dont bother taking them as they dont work just make me worse i keep telling the doctors that anti depressents dont work on me and actualy make my symptoms worse but hey they dont listern and just keep giving me pils saying they will make me better why dont they listern to what you tell them hope you ok and feeling well i am waiting for a appointment to go for a assessment as over the last 6 yrs my symptoms have drasticely changed the depressed state is more regular and last for twice as long now and i dont think i ever realy recover back to my normal state of mind before i sink in to a nother depressive state some times they can last for weeks with me having no feeling no emotions seeing no future and very suicidal wanting to end this battle once and for all but some how i manage to stay focused just enougth untill i pick up abit ,
42,2011-11-22 19:43:00,nomadic,"Sometimes ave had to take and anti-depressant for 4 weeks....sometimes...up to 12 weeks....When my Dr sees that after months on anti-depressants....not much improvement...Dr then suggests that I take a ""mood stabilisers"" to BOOST the effects of the anti-depressant....After battle, struggle, patience, and co-operation....my mood did improve...I had eighteen years on ma own before medication....Been ten on medication....Do not under estimate the severity of your illness my friend....not only the impact on you but as you have said yourself the impact that it has on your family.....I hope you get the relief from the symptoms of this illness soon.",
43,2011-11-22 20:19:00,madmark,like i say i got myself booked for a appointment for a new assesment as i havent been assessed in 20 years and my simptoms have drasticaly changed for the worse so once that is done i will know what is exacly wrong with me just wish they would hurry up been waiting over 2 months now and things are bad with me only just managing to keep control of myself and not do nothing stupid as i feel so low and cant see no point in life been like it for about 5 months now and it is wearing me down realy bad,
44,2011-11-25 02:10:00,lost!,thats a really good idea,
45,2011-11-26 09:07:00,madmark,ime feeling ok again now so i am trying to work out if there is any sort of pattern to my illness dont think there is as it can rapidly change oh i wish i was normal i hate feeling down 80% of my life,
46,2011-11-28 23:48:00,lost!,"if there is any kind of pattern to mine i have noticed more often than not lately i have 2 good 2 bad and 3 trying to pick up the pieces and apologise! for the complete mess i have made of things meds not changed my thoughts or feelings just slightly towards my appearance due to me sleeping but nothing to make me feel something other than the feeling that i am some how always getting things wrong no matter how hard i try i always fail like i'm just not enough and then thats it i'm gone a wreck blank on the outside and just silently crying on the inside hurting but just cant say it,would be easier just to let some one know how your feeling just by a touch my life is such a mess the blank exterior gives the false impression of not caring almost to the point that my partner always thinks i am angry i just dont know how to explain all this to him so that he can understand and he is understandably angry with me right now and is trying to support me still.He just will not give up he doesn't listen when i tell him i am a lost cause what do i do?Lost!",
47,2011-11-29 07:38:00,madmark,hi lost thats well said i am exacly the same at the mo i have had to shut myself down to protect myself from exploding and doing something silly 1000 things rushing around in my head and i cant make sence of it all my mrs is blaming herself again no matter how many times i tell her i cant help whats going on blank exterior and hurting like mad inside but not being able or should i say scared to reach out for help i hate draging people down with me and blame myself which then makes me worse its a vicsuse circle i am at the point were i am ready to through the towel in and give up on life i having alot more downs than up now and realy struggling inside myselt to find a way back to some sort of normallaty i keep trying and put on a happy face and involve myself with my family but just cant keep doing it it rips me apart in side after a couple of days and then once again shut down i hate this feeling feel so isolated and alone in a very nasty place within myself and there is nothing no one can do to help me it scares me as the only way i can see faward is to end my life to break the circle i am stuck in but also see that as hurting my family so i cant win but how much more punishment my body and mine will take i aint sure,
48,2011-11-30 23:25:00,lost!,"Hi mark,Yet again I could have written that myself!here is the scariest thing you are not the only one and neither am I there is 2 of us! exact same thought patterns temperaments everything it is always like reading my own thoughts as i am sure you will have noticed from reading my random babblings my train of thought is most irregular and mood snaps in an instant i have no idea what triggers me I know I can not stand untidiness it makes my head hurt and confuses me same as if things get moved in the shops and frightens me to the point i feel the urge to hide somewhere dark and quiet (god help me got to go christmas shopping for 5 kiddies this week plus family) I struggle with every day thing and if there is too much noise even when i am doing the simplist of tasks i get it wrong and the swings and round-a-bouts start again a never ending roller coaster of pure turmoil and hell it isn't very often sun shinning at this fun fair think i got stuck on the biggest scariest ghost train roller coaster that the human brain could ever manage to mis function!!!!",

51,2011-12-05 19:59:00,madmark,why when i love my wife and children so much do i feel its best if we split up and go our seperate ways it seems like all i do is make disissions to rip my own life apart and wont listern to what anybody else wants to happen in life i have been a mess for so long now i dont know what i realy want in life i keep haveing so many different emotions 1 minute happy and content then sad and want to push everyone away from me but i want it as i think i draging them down in life and they would have a lot better life without me in it so hard for me to work out what is going on in my mind and to try to explain it to my wife and children no chance its such a jumbled mess but cant get it out of my head they would be happyer with out me and have a better life my wife has stuck with me for 22 years of this mess why should i suddenly feel this way after so long i realy cant work it out it hurts me like hell to think i holding them back in enjoying there lifes to the full but inside its killing me pushing them away but i cant seem to stop doing it so nasty to feel the hurt and pain i suffering in side keep feeling like just going and ending what life i have left to stop all the hurt i feel i cant find no awnswers to nothing and like i say had this problem for 28 yrs cant keep fighting it and loseing the battle i have lost all hope in ever being and feeling happy just sad feelings and negitive thoughts all the time medication doesent work on me just makes me worse so what else can i do to change what is happening to me apart from ending my life to stop it once and for all i am so tiered all the time just go to work then get home and fall asleep no energy left for nothing,
52,2011-12-06 01:03:00,lost!,Mark you have to remember that no matter how you feel you have always and will always remain a very large and loved part of your families life no matter how down you get and how hard you push they are always waiting there for you when your mind returns you know what i am saying is right you tell me often enough! why not try to plan a surprise family get together over christmas never know bit of fesvive magic and a romantic glass in the still of the night with just you your wife and the snow may help remind you why we fight this because our loved ones are worth it they believe in us even threw the darkest of days with or without understanding or knowledge of what is the cause and more often than not wondering if it is their fault but yet past the dark and the grey you know that your wife is with you anxiously waiting for that little glint that tiniest of shimmer in your eye that lets her know that you are still there just temporarily unable to communicate that one little ray of light tells her that you love her and to her will be all she needs to help her be there to support you.xx please keep strong we seem to both be hitting our 2 down again.,

58,2011-12-10 01:27:00,lost!,I didn't mean to make you cry just try to help you see the woods rather than just the trees as you have done for me on numerous (these are big words for me lol)occassions.Chin up santa be here soon just think grandad thats cheery smiles and snow dust for you got to keep the magic alive and what better way than letting the little ones think santa has really been and put a stocking of treats on the end of their bed the best bit of christmas i think when i was little looking for the tangerine and the wined up toy fantastic  ,madmark

61,2011-12-12 21:32:00,madsue40,You could be describing me here! I have a lovely family and have been married for20 years but at the moment I feel so disconnected from everything. I push my husband to see if he is going to leave me but he doesn't - he loves me! Don't know why? My psychologist says I have to learn to connect with myself first then I might be able to connect with others! But it's bloody difficult!!Perhaps if you get an assessment you might need to do this also?My thoughts are with you - life is so bloody difficult!,madmark
62,2011-12-13 07:02:00,madmark,yes madsue40 i do try to conect but something in my mind stops me its as if i do the complete oppisit to what i want to do this isent easy to deal with but all i can say is try to explain to your husband how you feel and what happens so he knows it airt realy you pulling yourself away i feel like you say you push them to see if they are going to leave you i feel as if my wife could have a much better life away from me and be alot happyer without me thats what my mind tells me and i cant seem to see anything past that anyway its great to here from you i hope you are ok and have a good day today and i do talk to my wife as much as i can about how i am feeling if i can understand it myself sometimes i could spend 3 days piecing bits together in my mindso i can try to explain to her what ime feeling yes this is so hard to cope with and not a nice feeling,
63,2011-12-14 00:09:00,lost!,Hi Peggyann no you are not wrong as at the end of the day you now yourself better than anyone else does i awas on and off the drugs for a number of years and when on them found myself in the worst of states and more otfen than not ready to end it all the pills we are given are all chemical compound therefore man made our brains minds are not man made so no man is to say this drug made from chemicals is going to help your mind function the same as others every mind works differently and some mall function the answers i feel are not in the blister pack but in like minds wqho mall function the saqme way as yours does in that it will help you find the answers you need from others and from yourself and once you hit that road it is easier to see the woods not just the forrest there is hope you just have to believe in it and that old fashioned christmas magic never stop believing.,
64,2011-12-14 00:34:00,lost!,another like me and mark hi there I push to stop from hurting my partner if you read the posts between mark and myself in marks posts you may feel like you can find understanding in the strangest of places there is always a friend around even if it is a stranger sometimes they make the best of friends such as Mark he has been such a life line and always here with a note of encouragement waiting for me when i need it that is something you don't get from meeting people outside as they don't get to understand you as you don't let your random thoughts out so they are unsure of your frame of mind.you think it is easier to push your husband away to test him but why not see if it isn't just being with him that you are scared of it is such a good feeling to get that reassurance you need with a cuddle a snuggle up on a cold night with a cup of hot chocolate and funny film watching the snow fall threw the frosted up windows Christmas magic let it in and you will feel it help bring memories back your husband loves you he isn't going antwhere 20 years is a long time ti push and he is still there with you waiting patiently for the good days that you are the woman he feel in love with the 1 that in he's eyes is the love of he's life or would have gone you have to accept that before you push yourself he loves you not for you to question why just accept as i do with my partner and realise that no matter what your faults he see's past them as you are he's life! as we believe that our partners live with our illness it is just a fault in our brains our partners have their own faults in their eyes that we do not see because above all we love them no matter what as they love us.please remember that next time you see snow fall on a night and put the kettle on,

85,2012-01-15 22:33:00,madmark,here i am again y aint nobody replying to me i am going off the rails once again starting to lose hope and control was just talking to my wife about my counsoling and she says i would love to meet her and tell her what it is like living with you then she says but it will kripple me and rip me apart to here it now i realy cant see the point of us being married those few words have cut my heart and head in 2 whats the point of us staying together if thats what i or should i say my illness is doing to her i realy dont blame her for flirting with another bloke what the fuck its done my head in now realy dont know what to do mixed up feelings and emotions i love my wife but i know our relationship is rocky mostly due to me and my problems i shut myself down maybe i should just set her free by pushing her away from me so she has to start a new life elsewere without me atleast then she can live the rest of her life mine is fucked up anyway so why drag her down with me done expect any replys but hey enjoy reading my pain hope you all haveing a better time than me,
86,2012-01-15 23:29:00,wendolene26,"Hello madmarkI'm sorry you are having such a bad time at the moment. Try not to blame yourself too much, it is the depression talking and the depression which causes these thoughts and feelings. Perhaps instead of trying to talk to your wife and it ending up in an exchange of insults, why don't you write her a note explaining how you feel. She can then read this at her leisure and think about things.take care,Wendolene",
87,2012-01-16 07:31:00,madmark,hi wendolene i know its my depression but that doesent end the fact that the way i am is affecting my complete family that just hurts me realy bad and my depression uses it against me to drag me down thank you for posting to me i realy does help me i will put these feelins and emotions to 1 side in my mind as i can not deal with them at the moment as i do have a lot going on in my mind at the moment cant seem to work through them the counsoling i am having is realy messing my emotions about so its maling things feel worse than they realy are hope you are ok and well once again thank you,
88,2012-01-17 07:38:00,madmark,well here i am again calmed down abit now but this is a very mixed up world i am in at the moment well it is in my head and thats it it is in my head and it seems the more i try to put it right the worse i become i think possitive but within 1 day that possitive thought turns round to negitive and the list just grows with more and more negitive thoughts untill i go in to what i call overload and have to shut my mind down at the moment i have no emotions crying inside and a hard exterior shell so no body can see how i realy feel can only focus on next 2 days no further very forgetful and permantly down inside i am learning more and more about my feelings and thoughts and have learnt loads over the 23 years but still cant control them i just end up blank and sleep for 1 day and night once it gets to much like recharging my batterys ready for the next battle with my mind this is a very crual illness to have and i realy dont know how i have managed to survive for so long with it and just find the power and strenth to keep batteling it day after day minute by minute and one of the worse things is you just cant seem to explain it to no one and if you do manage to explain parts of it to people they cant understand it as like i say to people only people who suffer will understand each other because we are in the same or very simular worlds but hey here i go annother day to battle through,
89,2012-01-17 21:31:00,madmark,i feel i need medical tests to see if there is a problem with my brain i think i suffer from more than depression but all my doctor does is try to keep giving me anti depressant pills and they dont work on me i am going to ask my counsoler friday if she has the power to request my doctor to refer me for tests i have suffered most of my life in control then out of control and i got to breaking point at the end of last year i need awnsers and i need them soon is there anybody there would love to here you views and coments,
90,2012-01-18 08:24:00,madmark,thank you for your reply apotheosis makes intresting reading and i will bear this in mind like i say i suffered with this illness for the best part of 28 years and getting worse i do feel it isent just depression but something else i am a strong minded person but this is realy beating me down as it has been such a long lonly fight but i am still here living my life the best i can so i am still winning i have taken the 1st step and getting counsoling now cant wait for there outcome of what they think in 4 weeks time i am learning to drop my barrier and open up to people and try to talk as much as i can about my feelings i have been so low for last 6 weeks none stop with no feeling or emotion but managed to let out 3 tear last night which i have leant over the years is a good sign it meens i am slowly winning and starting to release some of the feelings in my mind this meens my emotions are slowly comeing back to me and yes to me that is 1 more step up my ladder to feeling better sems funny that if i can cry i feel it as a recovery doesent it hope you are well and ok once again thank you so much for taking the time to post to me,
91,2012-01-24 07:42:00,madmark,its been a while i feel i am heading for another big downer and i am struggling to keep control my emotions and thoughts are all over the place and i have bad thoughts just going round and round in my mind screwing me up why is it always the ones i love that mess my head about i have became so insecure in my marrage i feel i want to leave and devorce my wife i know she would be happyer and have a better life away from me and i am so messed up regarding this i feel as if i am punishing her for the way i feel dont think wrong of me i wouldent lay a finger on her or hit anyone but mental punishment is worse in my opinion and all i keep doing is pushing her away for her own benifit i am sick of draging her and my children down with me and i have spent last 6 months trying to change myself and stop it but it seems the harder i try the deeper i fall so maybe life on my own in my own messed up world is my only awnser but the next thing if i choose that path is i will see the hurt and tears from my wife and children and i realy dont think i can cope with that it will probely push me over the edge and end my life so i feel so traped in my world and cant find a way to sort it out so scared and mixed up and the fight i have with myself from the minute i wake is realy nackering me out cant find the energy to do anything else feel like the end of 28 now 29 years of fighting this illness is getting near time for me to stop all the hurt the only way i know how but still hanging in here for a little while longer looking for awnsers i cant seem to find i am having counsoling at the moment for another 3 weeks and i realy do want to see the report and results from that to close this chapter and hopefully have a few awnsers to what has fucked my whole life up from a young age my life has been one big figth with myself,
92,2012-01-24 20:41:00,madmark,why is there so many people reading my posts but no one has nothing to say to me am i that bad ?,madmark

100,2012-02-14 14:51:00,opendoorpsychiatry,"Hello MadMark,I am joining this thread very late, but I can see that you have been having a very difficult time. It sounds as if that medicines haven't really helped you so far, and the counselling is coming to an end and you are still feeling awful.I would suggest going back to your GP to explain how things just aren't getting any better. It is really important for them to know about the suicidal thoughts you have had so that they can ensure that you get the sort of help you need (by the way I don't mean being sectioned to hospital - that very rarely happens to people with depression these days). I wonder if you might benefit from having another go with a psychiatrist? They can help make the proper diagnosis and may be able to receommend treatmetns which your GP can't access.I hope things start to improve soon. Life always looks very bleak when one is depressed, but it doesn't have to be that way and most people find something which helps, though it can be a painfully slow business getting there.Best wishes,Andy",
