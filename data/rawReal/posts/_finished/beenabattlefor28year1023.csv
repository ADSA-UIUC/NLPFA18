2,2011-10-25 22:44:00,calypso,"b""Hey MarkYou say you change moods in the twinkling of an eye, and I would argue that is very rare in bipolar. Have you been formally diagnosed? I am interested that meds don't work at all. Sometimes this is indicative, not of bipolar, but of borderline personality disorder. You could look this up on the site on here. I am NOT diagnosing you, I cannot do that, of course, but the sudden swinging up and down as you feel is much more common in borderline. There is treatment for borderline, a specific therapy called DBT (not CBT). I know very little about it, but others know a lot. It may be an idea to check with your psychiatrist whether you have borderline, or that maybe they could look again at your symptoms. All of this is just a thought, and meds do not work on people with this disorder. There is hope honey. xx""",,Angelic
3,2011-10-26 06:58:00,madmark,b'thank you for your reply no i dont have bipolar many years ago i was told i was suffering from cronic depression this was when not alot was known regarding depression in the late 80s but the doctor who i see 2 months ago called it manic depression when i say chancge in minutes its not that 1 minute im happy then the niex sad its mainly just my thoughts i cant control them i always try to think possitive but i could be having a realy good day and suddenly my thoughts take over and twist my head about and make things bad to be honest i have seen so many doctors and psychiatrists over the years i gave up and started to just deal with my battle on my own had a realy bad turn 2 months ago and went to gas myself in my car had it all planed out got the pipe found the place and started to do it but managed to click out of it before it was to late i took this as a warning sign that i was out of control again so went to the doctors again was given more tablets and to be honest all the tablets do to me is make me feel stoned and i then lose my thoughts and feelings which i realy hate my thoughts get even lower and i realy do get low so stop taking them had 2 different types of tablets last month but both had the same affect on me when i tell the doc that he says i have to take them but i cant i get that low and very suicidle i cant lose the few possitive thoughts i cling to to keep me here or else i will end it all i have spent so long in this state i leant 90% control but still go overboard from time to time was ment to have councoling but they havent made me a appointment also told me i can only have 6 hours free then i will have to pay for it what a jokeso i guess i am on my own to deal with it again i do have my wife and family to support me but hate them seeing what it does to me as i push them away when i am bad and shut myself down cant stop it they learnt what happens to me aswell so they do know i cant help it but it hurts me so much to put them through it with me people dont seem to realise it affects all the people around you aswell i do work but some times it is so hard to stay focused all i think now after so long in this battle is that ime now 43yrs old so my life is running away and i getting older so i will pass away soon anyway sounds realy bad but thats what it has done to me just wish i could stop the pain for not only me but my complete family i used to deal with it on my own untill the last epesode 2 months ago then i opened up to my wife and started telling her my thoughts and righting them down on the time to change site letting her read my posts every day so she could see what is happening to me but i got the impression it was all to much for her as she got run down and kept crying so now i stoped and pulled back with telling her things for her own protection but there you go just a part of my life for you to look at i hope you are ok and well and once again thank you so much for taking the time to reply to me here is a link to the month i was on time to change go take a read then you will see more about how it affects my life http://www.facebook.com/#!/topic.php...99&topic=19270',,Confused
4,2011-10-26 10:55:00,maxitab,"b'Hi madmark. Twenty eitght years ago doctors were not very refined in their ability to diagnose, and to be honest, I would agree with mayfair, that this sounds much more like BPD to me than just about anything else. Have you looked at the criteria/symptoms. Many of us who have BPD do not respond to medication, but there are now a few very effective treatment ( not meds) options. If this were me I would go to my GP and ask for a proper assessment with a clinical psychologist and put down the manic depression label, since it is not, IMO true for you. Once you have a better idea of what is going on you will be able to access help. It is out there, why go on suffering?'",,Breezy
5,2011-10-27 06:41:00,madmark,b'i gave up asking for help 26 yrs ago as doctors were no good then and went and asked for help 3 times last month and no change all they do is give me pills that dont work and make me worse and a number for councoling which i phone spend 30 mins on the phone explaining what happens to me and they say they will contact me with a appointment but dont whats the point it just depresses me more and winds me up so give upcarry on as i am it realy isent nice but it has became my life thank you for replying its great to get a responce its very suportive for me another problem i dident mention is i dont like meeting people i hate going in to shops or crowded places i go all hot and sweat if i have to confront anybody so due to this i realy dont do much i do work but its so hard due to this problem i have what they say became a loner over the years lost most of my friends as i wouldent go out just wanted to be on my own all the time its so hard just to go to the local shop',,Confused
6,2011-10-27 10:27:00,maxitab,"b""HI again mark. I am supposing the isolation is due to anxiety, it sounds like it.First, I do need to ask, do you want things to be different? Because anxiety is a symptom of something that is going on that is not being addressed. Also, are you in the UK because being given a phone number for counselling does not sound like the UK....There is a service called IAPT which your GP can refer you to - is this it? If you are getting no result then you need to insist! Phone again and say you want to speak to the manager of the service and explain that you never get the promised appointment and ask who you can make a complaint with. It is amazing how people respond when you get a little pushy!In addition, there is some good help on line for anxiety, however, it is no good looking at it and thinkint 'that won't work for me' you have to be prepared to suspend your judgement and actually do it. If you want to try it, www.anxietycoach.comGood luck. Don't suffer in silence.""",,Breezy
7,2011-10-27 17:56:00,madmark,b'yes i am in the uk and the doctor gave me the number to call for a appointment which i did cant remember who it was with as i thrown the card away as they p*ssed me off saying i can only have 6 hrs then will have to pay for it think it was wellbeing service /mind its a joke realy does get me down and i do try my hardest to stay possitive but cant keep there just sink again i do have some good days well what i call good days but also have realy bad days / weeks and yes anxiety you hit the nail on the head its as if ime scared to go places so rather just stay in or go to places i already know i do want change have done for years but when i was younger 25 yrs ago had all sorts of pills and see a shrink for a year realy dident do me any good so was sent on my way as like i say a lost corse so had to learn my self to deal with my problems which i did quite well untoll say the last year were i am starting to lose control again think i got to the stage were i had enougth and realy cant be bothered fighting it now so i do lose my battle from time to time thank you so much for talking to me hope you are fine and well in yourself did you read my 1 months diary on time to change site of how my life goes i feel so useless and realy do think i would be better of gone from the people i love as i only seem to hurt and disapoint them due to my problems it drags everyone around me down realy aint good',,Confused

9,2011-10-29 09:59:00,maxitab,"b""Mark, did you look at any of the link I posted?What did you think of the suggestion that this may well be untreated BPD? I don't want to be or appear to be unsympathetic, but if it is BPD then I do feel you need to give the new more modern and aware Mental Health Service a second chance ( because you will be giving yourself a second chance along the way).Just because they failed you in the past is not a reason for staying angry at them. If you always do what you have always done - you will always get what you have always got. Try something new. Get on the website, and go and ask your GP for a proper assessment.""",,Breezy

11,2011-10-29 13:17:00,maxitab,"b""Hi again. The thing about the IAPT is that though they say 6 hours, they have the ability to extend it or to refer you to a different form of therapy if they think you need it, so though the 6 hours sounds silly, it could be good for what it may lead in to.I know one of the things lots of people do is to say they are OK when they are not so don't pull any punches with the therapist, say how things really are for you.I do hope you can get some ongoing help..........""",,Breezy

100,2012-02-14 14:51:00,opendoorpsychiatry,"b""Hello MadMark,I am joining this thread very late, but I can see that you have been having a very difficult time. It sounds as if that medicines haven't really helped you so far, and the counselling is coming to an end and you are still feeling awful.I would suggest going back to your GP to explain how things just aren't getting any better. It is really important for them to know about the suicidal thoughts you have had so that they can ensure that you get the sort of help you need (by the way I don't mean being sectioned to hospital - that very rarely happens to people with depression these days). I wonder if you might benefit from having another go with a psychiatrist? They can help make the proper diagnosis and may be able to receommend treatmetns which your GP can't access.I hope things start to improve soon. Life always looks very bleak when one is depressed, but it doesn't have to be that way and most people find something which helps, though it can be a painfully slow business getting there.Best wishes,Andy""",,None

Because you have this complicated mix of a thyroid problem associated with depression and not responding to standard treatments including counselling you should have the opportunity to see a psychiatrist.

I left my husband and my son decided to live with his dad as my illness freaked him out.I have to live without seeing my son grow up it's so hard living apart from my son he lives in Australia.

I just wanted to say keep on fighting the good fight - your children need you even though they're grown up now. Is there anywhere you can get psychotherapy or counselling for free? It may be worth ringing Mind or the Samaritans to ask them. If you don't get on with tablets your only other option is some kind of counselling or psychotherapy. I know you've had six sessions but that hardly even scratches the surface, you need much much more. You could try going to your GP, telling him you suffer with suicidal thoughts and asking to be referred to the Community Mental Health Team for your area. Also I would definitely ring your local Mind group to find out what services are available to you. You need help and it might take some running around to find it. Stay strong and keep posting.

I think it's still worth going to your GP and explaining you feel suicidal and need further help. There are many different types of therapy - CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy), DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy), psychodynamic etc etc. One of these may suit if it's possible you get enough sessions. To get some help you need to shout long and hard unfortunately. Good luck hun!""",,Psychedelic

184,2012-05-19 13:24:00,aircav,"b'Mark it very good news that you are fighting and winning and giving meds another attemp.I hate taking so many meds that I have to write them in a notebook each time I take a dose so I do not forget,I am on seven meds at this time-anti-depressants,mood levelers,anti psychotic ,schizo and so on.I know how you feel about loss of control but this stuff helps me tremedously.Besides my years in special forces I was in martial arts(kungfu san soo) for many years eventually making fouth degree black belt.Without medication I am afraid I might snap at someone and seriously injure them in seconds without realizing what I was doing.People love to upset each other and even threaten others they do not know.I am only revealing this to you Mark so you will understand some of the reason I must be medicated besides depression-mania seeing and hearing things not actually there and so on.When frustrated I exercise real hard.Weights 1 1/2 hr 5 times a week and run 2 miles am and 1 hr. cardio in afternoon 7 days a week.Once again -the feel good endorphins.But actually just trying to keep from being a fat old man. LOL I am very happy things are better for you at this time Mark.Please hang on to whatever is the positive motivator in your life at this time even its just a change in your mind or change of perception.Your doing good-on the correct track.Keep up the race ,never give up and if you fall just get up and keep going.

To get my dog on her lead and go for a long walk in our local countryside, forgot the chores,breakfast, just went.....We had a great time,walked through woods, alongside the river Nene, then around the large lake in our local country park taking in the scenery and the wildlife all round us. I said ""Good Morning"" to about 30 people. (30 more than I would normally!) Molly chased sticks, Rabbits and swam in the lake. I laughed out loud at her antics. So, 3 hours later and we`re sharing a ham roll indoors, my legs are aching, but thanks to your positive message we both had a great morning Mark.

224,2012-09-10 01:05:00,Gemini0605,"b'Hi Mark,I myself suffered with severe depression for about 30 years...it wasn\'t until I had a psychotic break in frontof my 8 year old daughter and was hospitalized, that the doctor\'\'s reassessed my condition and classed meas being ""Bipolar I"". Of course they have the variations, such as the more mild Bipolar II, Cyclothymia, Bipolar Spectrum, and Rapid Cycling. I myself have experienced manic episodes that are very Euphoric, but other times I have sever anxiety and panic attacks. But for the last 4 years I have primarily been at the severe depression level. So I\'m sympathetic to your plight. I will say self isolation does not help one bit. If you can socialize on a regular basis, staying in touch with your family and friends, that helps; I know it can be hard at times when you\'re severely depressed. I myself have days where I can remember what I\'m doing, I walk around dazed, almost like I have Alzheimer\'s disease. Then again other days, I rapid cycle quickly between feeling somewhat normal, then fall into deep depression, and next thing you know I have a severe panic attack. Fortunately, after recently getting out of the hospital, I am alot more stable, yet still depressed, but only moderately. Several other things I can\'t stress enough, if indeed you do have Bipolar disorder:(1) Get a regular scheduled amount of sleep; for example, go to bed at 11pm and wake up at 6am everyday of the week (that includes weekends).(2) Get some regular exercise...it doesn\'t need to be very physical....even a 30 minute walk each daycan help regulate the endorphin level in your brain, thus improving your mood.(3) Always be honest with your Psychiatrist and Therapist about how you feel, and how your medicationsare helping or not helping you.(4) Never miss taking your medications.(5) And although it may sound silly, always try to fit in some fun activities that make you smile andlaugh; laughter soothes the soul!I hope things progress and get better for you!Cheers for now.'",,Pensive

227,2012-09-10 02:45:00,Gemini0605,"b""Hi Mark,I hear what you're saying, and I've been through many of the same things as you...I'm 58 now, and afterlong depressions (and treatment) over the years, in 2001, just after the 9/11 tragedy, I had my psychoticbreak which hospitalized me, and subsequently had the Doctor's re-diagnosing me as Bipolar I. I too havemany times had suicidal ideations, but fortunately, it too was the thought of leaving such an awful legacy for my wife and daughter. And, it still is a struggle, even though my depression for the past week has only been mild (the new meds I think are helping....yea!). Anyway, prior to going into the hospital, for years my sleep hygiene was almost non-existent...sometimes I wouldn't sleep for several days, other days, I would sleep 36 hours, and some days 1 to 4 hours, etc. That's one of the worst things a person can do to their body (sleep deprivation); and those of us that have Bipolar Affective Disorder, it is even worse... it can trigger manic episodes, anxiety or panic attacks, or cause you to sink into deeper depression.Strangely enough, during my recent 10 day hospital stay in the Veteran's Hospital psyche ward here in Atlanta, Georgia, I was (gently) forced to go to bed at 11pm, and wake at 6am. When I was finally released, I thought I would be able to follow through on my own with the same sleep schedule...but...old habits die hard...so this past 5 days, I'm back into my bad sleep habits, although it hasn't yet triggered any negative events (crossed fingers!). But I know I need to get back into a routine sleep schedule; it isn't always easy...I for example avoid going to sleep many times, since I tend to have violent dreams (revolving around the vietman war of which I'm a veteran). Other times I just get so obsessed with what I am doing (primarily using my computer), that I lose track of time and procrastinate.Long story short, if you can create a routine to allow you to get to bed at the same time, and wake at the same time, that will benefit you greatly I think. I recommend to stop watching television or playing video games an hour before bed. Make your bedroom a quiet peaceful place for sleep (intimacy is OK too, LOL). Then an hour before sleep time, head up to your bedroom, and get ready for bed. Maybe use 10 to 15 minutes before bed, and read an inspirational passage in a self help book, the bible (or other religious text if you're so inclined), or listen to a DVD specifically designed to aid in relaxing you and preparing you for a good nights rest.Regarding feeling alone...unfortunately, that comes as part of the package of depression, whether it be regular depression, or bipolar depression. That's why socializing is important. Try hard to do the things you know you need to in order to stay healthy. Let your loved ones, family and friends know of your illness, if you haven't yet done so. Of course this forum is a great tool too (I don't get out hardly at all, since I'm too disabled to work, and have lost interest in doing those things I once had a passion for). But I believe if you slowly try harder each day, to accomplish just one more goal, no matter how small it may seem, and remember to be thankful and congratulate yourself for doing it, you eventually will start feeling better (assuming you are on adequate medication and do get therapy). So as usual, I've written a novelette (LOL)...therefore I'll just say that here on the forum we care, and you'll always have someone who will try and help.Take care for now Mark!Cheers""",,Pensive

232,2012-09-13 21:55:00,Gemini0605,"b""Hi Mark,I'm sorry to hear you're in a bad space right now; however, it is greatly important that you focus on those good things in your life...specifically your family. Try to think of past times when you had happy times, and realize you still have the capacity to be happy and enjoy the companionship of family and friends. I truly believe if you shift your focus to the good in your life (and I know its not easy when you fell such despair), that it will slowly lift the shroud of depression. I've been in the same dark depths in the past, thinking they would never pass, and why the fuck keep on living...but they do pass, and things do improve. True for some episodes it takes longer, and others less time. But you need to keep reminding yourself there is hope, and there are people that care about you. Stay strong Mark....I know you have the will to persist and make your way through this difficult time. """,,Pensive
233,2012-09-14 06:28:00,madmark,b'thank you for the suport gemini i been here so many times in my life and the problem is i now so fed up with fighting with myself i have no emotions what so ever again cant cry to let out some of the pressure i have real trouble talking to my loved ones i dont know what to say my mind is a mixed up blank mess if that makes sence and i just cant let people in to my mind to feel there love and support i get a total mental block on life its like something else is running my life and i just have to sit quitly inside and watch it hurting all around me as i can see how much it hurts my family to see me go through this all that is in my head is when i went to kill myself about 6/10 months ago why the fuck dident i just carry it through and put a stop to all the suffering for me and my family but its because i see the image of the after affect it will have on my wife /children/grandchildren/friends i just want my life to end but all them to be happy for me as my suffering would have stoped but that just cant happen as they all love me i realy dont want to put the mental traumer of my suicide on them so i am in a no win situation live and hurt them die and hurt them i know this sounds so maubid and fucked up but its got to the point were i think shall i toss a coin to decide which way to go heads stay alive or tails go end my life how fucked up is that i just see alot of pain and suffering in the future which ever way i go i try so fucking hard to stay focused and be happy with the lovely family i have been blessed with but i am in this constant fight with myself and other symptoms are starting to come in to my life now i cant face people i cant soctiolise i find it hard to just do the simple things like go in to a shop to buy something just cant do it most of the time cant talk on a phone it scares me for some reason i dont know why ?all of this is just issolating me more and more ime still hanging in here for now just dont know what to do i need this downer to pass very quickly as i dont have much strenth this time and i just cant seem to focus on possitive as i keep thinking ime just once again setting myself up for another fight in the near future so scared and lonely',,Confused
234,2012-09-14 07:18:00,Gemini0605,"b'Hi Mark,I understand your feelings...I have been there myself, where you just want to end the pain...but I, like you resisted following through, knowing that is not a legacy I want to leave for my loved ones.Self isolation only makes things worse...if I may use a metaphor, its like sinking deeper and deeper in a depth-less ocean, trying to hold your breath, struggling, and trying not to exhale and end the battle. You need to be among people...and I don\'t mean just be in the same house or apartment with them (i.e. - your loved ones). Do they know the depth of despair you feel; I know you say you can\'t talk to them about it...but you should. Do you have a therapist, or go to group therapy; both of these can be therapeutic. Are you currently working, or unemployed? If you\'re unemployed (or retired), it can cause self-isolation to be that much easier to do...not a good thing. So, I stress very much, that you get out among people; and I find it more effective to get out of your home and socialize. Going for a daily walk in your neighborhood, if you\'re not physical handicapped and can\'t, will produce endorphins, which will naturally give your mood a lift. So, if you could do a 20 to 30 minute walk each day, and while doing so, just take in nature. If your neighborhood is too stressful for you, perhaps drive a short distance to a park, and walk there. You need to start involving yourself in life. I know with depression, one can lose interest in the things they used to enjoy, and ultimately self isolate to the point of suicide, as is your case. But we have to have courage, and try, regardless of how difficult and hopeless it seems. You should avoid the ""all or nothing"" mentality...its unhealthy. Give yourself permission to take small steps at first, slowly achieving things you would like to; you\'ll find that after achieving a small milestone, it gives a lift, small but still a lift. Each any every other small goal met, lifts you more and more. But the first step is having the courage to try, and then taking the action.And last (without me going and reading your entire thread), the title of your thread ""Been a battle for 28 years with no medication"" implies you take no psychiatric medications. Is that true? If so, why don\'t you see a psychiatrist and get evaluated.I hope this message in some small part gives you hope. Until next time.'",,Pensive

236,2012-09-14 20:00:00,Gemini0605,"b'Hi Mark,Given your depression, from what you\'ve told us, is medication resistant, you might wish to discuss otheroptions with your psychiatrist. One such option, ECT (Electro Convulsive Therapy), has been known to work for some medication resistant patients. The treatment is not at all as it was depicted in the film ""One flew over the cuckoos nest"". Now a days, they still strap you down, administer a muscle relaxer, then administer anesthesia prior to placing the probes on each side of your temples. Once the shock is administered it causes a seizure. The side effects are short term memory loss. In the states they administer 4 treatments over the course of 2 weeks (e.g. Tuesday, Thursday of each week). I met a Veteran while I was hospitalized in the Psyche ward recently, who said it is the only treatment that helps him. He mentioned the effect can last between 3 to 6 months before you need another treatment. I know it sounds extreme, but it is done alot more humanely than people think, and has a success rate that is documented. So, you might discuss this with your Psychiatrist as an option. I wish you well! '",,Pensive

262,2012-09-28 09:19:00,Gemini0605,"b'I know what you\'re talking about Mark, although I can\'t explain the ""why""...other than the level of our neurotransmitters are messed up, which causes that frame of mind we get into. Fortunately, I\'ve only been mildly depressed as of late (fingers crossed). But when I get severely depressed, I can only focus on the ""past"", and everything wrong that has happened in my past...and of course it makes me spiral lower and lower, wanting to just give up. The medication I\'m on now seems to be helping, although I still get depressed (but not severely). Once one is stabilized with meds, so they are not suicidal or out of touch with reality, then therapy can assist in restructuring the way we think about things. Methods such as CBT, and its derivative DBT are two methods that have proven successful for some. I don\'t know if you\'ve tried them, but I\'ve dabbled a little in CBT and it helps. I have a DBT workbook on order from Amazon right now, because I know my thought patterns...that is my response to events can be over-reactive, or skewed...if DBT can help in correcting these thinking patterns, then I should have a better chance of rebounding from triggered events, instead of over reacting and falling into deep depression.But I know the feeling you describe...I\'ve had those same feelings...its almost like you just want a lobotomy so you won\'t have to think that way.Well, the weekend isn\'t to far off...so maybe you can relax more, and spend time with the family, and chill out.Good luck!

357,2013-03-21 06:59:00,|||ME|||,"b""Hi madmark, I think you should do what you would like to do in regards to your relationship with your wife. Which it comes across to me is obviously to continue it.I think the best person to decide what is best for your wife's happiness is herself. I don't think you should make that decision for her. People are bad at making that kind of decision for other people all the time, but especially when they are emotionally distressed and it makes them feel they bring less to other peoples lives than they do.Concentrate on your own wellness, your wife can decide for herself what she wants. It sounds like she wants to be with you and loves you very much. Don't deny her that if it's also what you want. You'll just be hurting both of you.The best thing you can do for your wifes happiness is focus on your own wellbeing right now.Imagine the other way round. You love her you'd want to support her. It would hurt more not to be able to than it would to be there through the ups and downs.Good luck, take careME""",,Cynical

364,2013-03-22 05:52:00,|||ME|||,"b'hi madmark, how you doing now?no wonder you\'ve had a nightmare after cutting all that coffee cold!Don\'t do that again lolJust remember that looking after yourself the best you can is the best thing you can do for everyone else too. If that means you have spells where you need to withdraw then go with it. It you fight it and beat yourself up over it you\'ll make it worse than it has to be. Easier said than done but see it as a process of learning to accept it rather than fight against it. Although it\'s there beating yourself up makes it worse than it would ever be without being so hard on yourself. Practice not trying to stop but trying accepting it and not beating yourself up. I\'ve been there - it doesn\'t help. Worrying about going mad can be what sends you mad in the end. Be kind to yourself.This thread is my approach to some of the experiences I\'ve had. I\'ll lie down or sit down and just focus on my breathing and my heartbeat (which will be pumping out my chest) and just try and root myself in it and ""watch"" my thoughts and accept and experience whats happening to me. It\'s referred to as mindfulness, and meditation can be a good way of controlling anxiety and becoming calmer. It\'s not for everyone but looking up the people I refer to in one post on youtube might be worth a try. Sometimes it\'s worth trying things that might feel a bit different and outside our comfort zones. I wouldn\'t have imagined me doing this stuff as a young tearaway lol, but it\'s proved very useful. Some people who used to know me would piss themselves at some of the stuff I try now. It might not be for you, but no harm in trying something like that and finding out - I tried yoga and felt like an idiot, feeling like an idiot made me laugh, as did how inflexible I was. Turned to that helped more than yoga lol. Some stuff works in mysterious ways.Some exercise is another useful tool, especially when you least feel like it. If it wears you out and you sleep that\'s a great result too. Cutting down on bad foods like sugar and caffeine and things like that will help if you don\'t just do it all at once!!!Also keep that in mind about your wife. Unresolved decisions take up mental energy that we need. Thinking about whether people are better off without you is one of those types of decisions. She\'s a big girl, she can make her own. She has the options and limiting someones options like that doesn\'t make them happier. And thinking about that decision doesn\'t do you any good either. Resolve that decision by saying and affirming that it\'s not yours to make. Imagine the other way round - you\'d want to be there and so does she. It would make you unhappier not to be allowed to not happier. If ever she doesn\'t, she wont - but that\'s her choice. Don\'t end it on her behalf, it\'s not the ""right"" thing to do - it\'s a thing that makes her life worse.Best thing you can do for her and the kids is focus on yourself, especially when you\'re really struggling.Do you have any strategies for calming yourself? What do you think you should do when this happens? Like if you were to make a plan of what to do what would it be? A plan can help because then you know what to do when you start losing it - it\'s hard to decide once you\'re there.What things do you do that relax you whether you\'re struggling or not? Maybe you need to make more an effort to make time and do them more often to help prevent getting to this stage. Oh - and eat something if you haven\'t yet man! Just something light, try some soup or something if you don\'t want anything heavy. Or whatever you think you can manage.Good luck with it allTake careME'",,Cynical

Maybe it's more like riding a punch. It's coming, you can't change that, but if you don't tense up and fight it so hard, you can accept it's coming, accept you're going to get hit, and then ride it with less pain than you currently experience. Meeting head on a force that's coming anyway can just mean a heavier collision. Riding it can take some of the sting out.What we can't stop, we must accept.

407,2013-04-16 16:30:00,|||ME|||,"b""Mark. The thing is this. The problems you've had, they effected your wife also. There is a process she needs to go though, and you need to respect it. It moves at a different pace and in different ways to the one you ideally wish, but you are two different people and have experienced the relationship from different angles. This is natural.My own view is I would not interpret it the way you have. If she felt that way I don't believe she would be spending this time enjoying herself with you and at the same time speaking about healing the relationship and trying to rebuild things at the deeper levels.What I would interpret that as saying, is that although things are going well, and you are enjoying time together, there are residual issues from what's gone before that still effect her. She may well be hurting still from the things she/you both has/have gone through, and to me it's a prod that hey, mark, at some point we need to discuss and work on these, they won't just go away for me. I've been effected, please don't pretend they just disappear for me, I'll need your help with them, and for you to respond to how I feel, for us to have what I need. = Otherwise I can't do this, because I need that.My advice is that at some point you will have to listen and understand and validate and react positively to what she has been through over these years. Without taking it personally. And she's telling you this. When the time comes, let her have her say - in whatever way she needs, and try not to take it personally or make it about your views, concentrate on hers. Appreciate that the same event viewed from two different angles has two separate lives. I like to explain it like this. Place a vase of flowers between two people. Ask each to draw a picture of them. The pictures will differ, yet each will have been drawing their truth and each picture is of equal validity. It's the same thing, but viewed from different angles it takes on a different form.For reconciliation in a relationship their needs to be shared understanding and respect for each others picture. Each needs to able to show it and have it respected and understood without judgement and without the other trying superimpose their own picture over the others. If you've had the problems you've had for 28 years, it is implicit in the mere fact she's stood by you for so long she's done a lot of this for your picture. If you feel well, or even less unwell, one of the valuable and healing things you can do is to spend some time doing the same for hers. We, if we are fortunate enough to recover, need to understand that for others ... the same break in events does not occur. They feel essentially the same as they did yesterday, whereas you may not. That needs to be respected.She wants to tackle those issues and hurt because she loves and wants to be with you. It's when someone doesn't that the relationship is over. Arguments/debate/antagonism, struggling for the right word there ... expressing different points of view on things - they are a sign that someone still cares. That they are trying to make things the way they need them to be. Don't misinterpret those things as not caring, or as criticism. What she wants is to heal, not to distance, and those comments are telling you how important that process is to her and your relationship That's imo, from here - and is not meant as criticism of you either, I think you're a really nice guy doing his best and this is all meant in a friendly tone, it's just that you seem like you would like to forget the past (fully understandably), but your wife has not had the same significant change in herself that you have, which means you'll have to work through that stuff with her or else it will look to her like you don't care - no matter how much effort you direct towards looking the direction you want to look. You show you care by looking where she needs to look at at times too, even when you don't want to. In fact, especially when you don't want to.___________I'd also suggest that you push for someone to talk to about your own experiences. Can take a lot of working out this stuff that's gone on and is going on, I think you'd benefit from counselling. You've shut down for a period of time emotionally from what I can read, and the return of those emotions takes some steering and dealing with at times, as you appear to be experiencing yourself. In your position, I'd want that support and would I benefit from it. I think it would help.It's always a possibility when someone's emotions switch off that it's the brains protective mechanism for dealing with overwhelming emotions and feelings. If you process them you will reduce the chance of the same thing happening again in future, and at the same time be getting support with dealing with the return of them. Something which I know from experience isn't easy, in different circumstances I've done that myself.""",madmark,Cynical

I find they actually have benefits for me these days, probably because I am more robust than I use to be. The side effects can be very unpleasant but usually they will make you better in some ways, if not others. Have you tried citalopram because that's a fairly new drug, and its often prescribed for depression these days? I've recently gone back on 20mg, it and its helping at the moment. I don't know how long they will help because sometimes the problems set in later on. When is your assessment taking place?

I just run away for a while still to try sort myself out for now this is the only way I know how to deal with the changes at a steady pace  its good but very scary and sometimes painful for me to experience ime slowly seeing the damage my depressive state I been in for most of my life has reflected on people around me my wife/children this is hurtful and I have to kick myself everyday stating the fact that it isent my fault but this hurts so much ime slowly learning at a steady pace to handle changes this is the hardest and most scaryest thing I have ever had to face in my life all I want to do is stop it and run but I know deep down its all part of my recovery so I hang in along as possible and feel the emotion and confusion in my mind to the extent it becomes a mass of confusion then I go shut it down and sort out what ime feeling then start again if that makes sense hope you all ok and well',,Confused

750,2014-11-03 08:48:00,BernieDolores,"b""That sounds good. Unfortunately I do not have the support of my husband, he thinks anything I do to do with helping my self mentally is bad, even going on the 'looney forum' as he calls it. having had cbt and therapy half of my problem is my husband, but I am too scared to go it alone, so have to carry on. When I had my breakdown in 2011 I felt totally alone, and felt bad as his family who are Christian, thought all this was a bad thing, and not to be talked about. Imagine how I felt when I found out his uncle, who had gone to Oxford, had had a breakdown, and to the extent he was hospitalised, as he threatened to kill himself by pouring inflammable substances over himself, he had had episodes before. I felt really betrayed that 'the family' had not told me and had let me feel an outcast. Anyway, your experience sounds much better, so glad you have got your wife and family behind you, that is half the battle if you think you are totally alone. Do you go riding on your bike? my husband has a few motorbikes, and did have his own bike website, but he hasn't been going out so much due to the cost of the petrol, looks as if that might be coming down though, I was told it will be \xc2\xa31 by Xmas!!""",,Tired

What tests are the doctors doing, or are you seeing a specialist?You don't have to reply in the forum, but maybe the illness is caused by something else? You might be surprised, but there are times when the body isn't getting what it needs, and this can affect the mind in various ways. For years I was severely ill (mood swings, depression and paranoid with psychosis), and I had to have tests and change certain things in my life. Only after these changes, then my health came back gradually. Maybe ask your doctor for other tests to see what's going on? I'm happy to let you know which tests to try.Remember, just one step at a time.

905,2016-10-10 20:14:00,BorderlineDownunder,"b""so youre about my ageshes never been the same since the hyster bc shes gone into menopauseor as me and my girlfriends refer to it, MenOnPause.  Because they take out your female hormones they also remove the part that Thinks It Needs A Man.I'm sorry. It just happens, naturally even, to a lot of women. Its like whatever compelled you to partner up in the first place, is removed, especially when you've raised your kids and don't need that Male Role Model.A lot of single older ladies are single by choice. I'm in that group and so are most of my friends. Its NO ONES fault but there's no reversing it either.If you set her free now she may come back as a friend and still be an important loving part of your life.on the other hand it leaves YOU free to explore choices toothe plus side = you get to date new women. its not all doom and gloom. How about putting yourself on a dating site, you may be pleasantly surprised because a lot of older women DO want a man, in a years time you might be thanking her for setting you free to meet the Love of the Rest of Your Life!""",madmark,Cool

Key is to remember that humans are remarkably resilient and capable. Because depression can cloud your judgement, it can be tempting to overemphasize the negative aspects of situations, while discounting the positives.Commit to a new way of thinking and you will commit to a new way of being. If living in the past takes up a lot of your mental real estate, this article will help you rewire your thought process. Past regrets serve one purpose and that is to rob you of your resolve to do things differently in the present.""",,None

983,2018-08-27 12:05:00,JCPraha,"b'Hello Mark,Actually, I am really quite amazed at all you have been able to do in your life, given your problems. I understand, because I have been battling the depression and mood swings, for my entire life. Unfortunately, it seems that the fight does not get any easier as I age. I suspect it may be the same with you. I also have children and fortunately, I was able to work the majority of my life, but it has been a struggle. Medications did help me quite a lot for some time, but stopped working. I am now quite depressed and really cannot function very well. You are fortunate that your family is so patient and understanding with you. Really, you are fortunate. My behavior and mood swings destroyed my family life, which is understandable.I understand how many pills did not work for you. I have had bad side effects with meds and they stopped working for me as well. For me, I need to try to find a solution. To accept this terrible existence with no hope for change, would make it very difficult to keep going. I have read of some newer techniques for treatment resistant depression. I will give them a try and keep you posted. It seems Ketamine is a possible solution. There are also some new meds Brexillin is one. I perfectly understand your reluctance to take medications, given your experience. I can only say that I perfectly understand how difficult life can be, while fighting these types of problems. I wish I could say that it will get easier, but at least for me, it seems to get more difficult to cope with as I get older. All the best to you. Keep up the good fight. - James'",,Tired

You are able to keep going under very stressful conditions, which would be very difficult for anyone. Take care, I hope somehow things will improve. James'",,Tired

I think almost anyone would have difficulty coping with it. The anger is also understandable, but you need to let go of it. Staying angry will make you bitter and really have a bad effect upon your mental state. Maybe this will help, this is what they say in AA meetings. I think it is quite useful:God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. The things you cannot change, you must accept, and let go of the anger. It will destroy you over time.'",,Tired

It doesn't harm anyone but yourself and it won't do your brother or anyone else any good. I know it is easy for me to say. But you must. For your own peace of mind.""",madmark,Tired

I really hope you will be able to get some rest because all of the stress has a bad effect upon your own health and well-being. No one can say anything that will make things easy for you, it is not possible. Take care of yourself in this very difficult time in your life.""",,Tired

You will feel guilty for many years if you do not. It will be very painful, but I think you must go and the rest of your family can use your support. Take care.'",,Tired
