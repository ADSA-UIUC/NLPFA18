2,2/1/19 16:01,person1,b'Hearing  my mother tell me hello after her being in a coma for two months. I cried like a little girl.',,
3,2/2/19 16:01,person1,"b'hearing the girl i liked accepting to be my girlfriend. It didn't work out but i still remember i was the happiest dude alive, on top of the fucking world. Before that i was so self-conscious but knowing that someone liked me enough to want to spend time with me in a relationship made me the happiest man and in general just confident with myself. Thanks to that though the relationship didn't end well i don't worry about self-esteem issues anymore.'",,
4,2/3/19 16:01,person1,"b'Becoming a dad after 6 years and 3 awful miscarriages. my daughter will never fully understand how much we cherish her, but it's ok with me. she will also never discover the oath i made over her crib to always do my best to keep her happy, no matter what her life choices will be. as long as i remember these things I don't care if she appreciates it.Other happy moments may seem mundane to others but I still cherish them - mostly teenage moments involving music and weather. favorite music and dramatic weather always gave me a sense of euphoria that I can't really reenact as an adult.'",,

7,2/6/19 16:01,person1,"b'Two days ago I sold my business for $2.5 million. Was ten years of work to get it to that point, and now I'm starting a new business that I expect will be much bigger. I'm now officially a millionaire, at age 28.This also allows me to finally move to another city to live with my boyfriend full-time. I've been flying back and forth for almost two years to see him, and although I did live out there for six months at one point - this'll be my first time really moving in with someone long-term.The day itself was kinda surreal. Had to say farewell to the staff that we've worked with for many years. We gave everyone $2000 for each year they'd worked for us (personal gift so they don't pay tax on it), which I think was well-received.'",,
8,2/7/19 16:01,person1,b'The happiest I remember being was when our plane landed coming home from Iraq into Germany. Trees have never looked so green. It was euphoric.',,

12,2/11/19 16:01,person2,"b'I had been underemployed for a year and a half before I was offered a full-time job in my field. I'd had plenty have happy moment before this: falling in love, getting engaged, getting married, but those were all over shadowed by hardships (see: underemployed). After they offered me the job, I remember my husband and I half hugging, half jumping up and down. We were both crying out of pure relief. It felt like our lives were finally starting.'",,

We didn't do anything exciting but it's one of the most fun times I've ever had. We talked and laughed the whole time and it was just one of those close moments between us. It was one of those weekends where no other worries I had seemed important.',,
15,2/14/19 16:01,person2,"b'I have never experienced that constant feeling of euphoria, like the whole world could burn down but it wouldn't matter because our relationship was the only thing I needed in the world. Sadly it didn't last, but that short span of time was the happiest I have ever been.'",,
16,2/15/19 16:01,person2,"b'Right now. I'm 50. Life gets better and more interesting all the time. I don't give a shit what people think quite so much, I have more money, I can see the end of my working life on the horizon but I'm still useful and I'm in the best physical shape of my life.'",,
